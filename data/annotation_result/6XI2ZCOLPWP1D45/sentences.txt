6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.8389.1	Few diets focus, as they should, on non-processed nutritionally dense food--instead, in many cases, the patient is actually eating even more processed food products, exacerbating rather than solving the problem.
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.8389.2	<br /><br />Bottom line, as we hear so often, obesity is largely caused by bad habits in terms of diet and exercise, and many people aren t willing to permanently let go of those habits, so it s hardly surprising when they fail to achieve the results they want.
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.0	I think that the main reason is that obese people should be treated as drug addict. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.1	The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.2	Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.3	Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets.
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.4	<br />Another major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US, an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.5	By that, the government actually encourages obesity. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.6	Why would someone even try to get better?
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.7	<br />Authorities should condition those allowances: if you lose weight over a specified period you will continue getting it. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.8	If you did not lose weight you lose the allowance.
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.9	<br />We should always keep in mind that obesity costs a lot more then just the allowance that the obese person gets. 
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.10	There is the health costs, taxes lost and so on.
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.11	<br />I say- do what you can to leave healthy life, and don???
6XI2ZCOLPWP1D45.70502.12	t give up
