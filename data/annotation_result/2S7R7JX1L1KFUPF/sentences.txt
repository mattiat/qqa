I know it sounds boring and unintimidating, but try listening to some music, maybe dance around while cleaning, that burns calories. Also, I used to lose alot of weight when I was a bedroom dance team choreographer, ohhmyy the girl in the mirror had some swift moves! Haha..
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.1	You said you re pretty much late to school everyday, how about after school? Getting off the bus a stop early? When you re at school, walk quicker to classes. Maybe try pacing back and forth as you talk on the phone..
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.2	If you re old enough, a job would help.
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.3	 That keeps you from sitting around, keeps you moving, and it keeps you from binge eating like you might do when you re bored.
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.4	 These are just some simple tips that I ve done and lost quite a few pounds in a short period of time.
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.5	 I ve had my job 2 months and have lost 20lbs, so use weightloss as motivation to get up and move.
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.6	 My mom is constantly complaining about her weight, I just simply tell her, It must not bother you that bad if you don t do anything about it!
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.7	 You re just in the habbit of complaining.
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.8	 So just try moving around a bit.
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5528.9	 You d be surprised.

2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.0	Sorry but the only way to exercise is exercise.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.1	You must commit to exercising, and why can t you add in real exercises?  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.2	What is a fake exercise?  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.3	If you have free time the only thing you lack is will power.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.4	You must find willpower through yourself, friends, and family.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.5	A good way to commit to is make a schedule and write it out.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.6	I m not sure what you want to do as exercise but you should do many different exercises to see what you like the best.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.7	Exercise should be fun and good for you.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.8	If push-ups and sit-ups don t work.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.9	You could swim, box (as in boxing), walk around the house, or join a class like karate, dance, or aerobics.  
2S7R7JX1L1KFUPF.5529.10	All exercise takes is a little will power and time,  just find that will power and stick to your schedule and you should be good.
