2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.0	Some of the reasons have been already mentioned:1) Many missions to Mars have been unsuccessful.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.1	  To send people to Mars, we ll have to use technology that is almost foolproof (although we can never eliminate all risks).
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.2	  This raises the cost tremendously.2) After landing on Mars, the astronauts need to return to earth.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.3	  This also adds a great deal of expense (which is made greater by the fact that we want to minimize the possibility of an unsuccessful manned mission).3) A trip to Mars and back will take quite a while - maybe two or three years.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.4	  You re correct that there have been some very long stays on the International Space Station (up to 803 days, or about 2.2 years).
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.5	  The long trip to Mars would be psychologically difficult on the astronauts, but comparable to the longest stay on the ISS.4) There s one more important thing that hasn t been mentioned so far:  Because the astronauts would be outside of the protective magnetic field of the earth for a very long time, they would be exposed to a substantial dose of cosmic rays - enough to give them a considerable chance of developing cancer as a result of the trip..The
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.6	There was a very good article on the cosmic ray problem by Eugene N.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.7	 Parker in the March 2006 Scientific American.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.8	  I don t think it s available free on the web, but you should be able to find it at a library.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.9	  Also, there is an interview with Parker on this subject here:http://www.

2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.12	cfm?id=0002212E-EEEC-1404-ADC683414B7FFE87The article (Shielding Space Travelers) is available here for a fee:http://www.

2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.15	cfm?id=shielding-space-travelersParker s main point is that there is no known way (for now, at least) of protecting astronauts from this radiation exposure.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.16	  (By the way, Parker is a very famous astrophysicist who has specialized in the study of magnetic fields and the solar wind.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.17	)-- editHere s a very good link on the cosmic ray problem:http://science.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.18	nasa.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.19	gov/headlines/y2004/17feb_radiation.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.20	htmIt mentions that the daily dose of cosmic rays on a mission to Mars is about three times greater than that experienced in the International Space Station.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.21	  Thus, a two-year trip to Mars produces three times as much radiation damage as a two-year stay on the ISS.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.22	  The author of this article is more optimistic than Parker that there might be a technological solution to reduce cosmic rays to a reasonable level.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.23	-- editThere s one other major thing I haven t mentioned - politics.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.24	  Do people really want to spend the money for a manned trip to Mars?
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.25	  In the 1960s, the U.S. wanted to prove that it had better technology than the Soviet Union (and there were other military and technological motivations as well).
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.3807.26	  The political climate today is very different from the one that spurred the race to the moon.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.0	Moon landing was old news. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.1	When the hell are we getting to Mars? 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.2	You are easily bored, aren t you?
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.3	:-)Seriously. with enough tax money everything is possible. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.4	Even a manned Mars flight. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.5	But somebody has to pay for it. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.6	I would estimate it to be a rough trillion dollars. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.7	Half as much as the Iraq war. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.8	Why don t you send a letter to Bush and Cheney?
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7994.9	:-)
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7995.0	Keeping some guys alive in the vacuum (and weightlessness) of space is exceptionally tricky.  especially if we want them to come home..
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.7995.1	Patience
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.20901.0	Getting there is the easy part. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.20901.1	Lifting off and getting back is the hard part. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.20901.2	They would have to carry enough fuel for the entire journey, not to mention food, air etc etc. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.20901.3	Remember, unmanned probes just have to survive a one-way trip and the landing.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.42705.0	MOST of the probes we send to Mars all the time actually failed..
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.42705.1	So.. wanna volunteer for  Mars 1?
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.0	Because Those unmanned probes only weigh a few hundred pounds while Apollo weight over a hundred thousand pounds. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.1	And because it only takes 3 days to get to the Moon and a complete round trip with several days stay can be completed in 10 days while it takes 8 months to get to Mars and because you can only leave when the Earth and Mars are in just the right parts of their respective orbits the astronauts would have to stay on Mars a year before the planets were lined up right to return, making the whole trip last over 2 years. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.2	No astronaut has ever been in space for so long. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.3	The space station needs supplies and spare parts every 6 months. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.4	No space craft ever built can last 2 years without support from Earth and the size of the space craft needed to carry 2 years food, water and air would be far to big to launch on our largest rocket. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.5	The space station orbits low enough over Earth that it is always inside Earth s magnetic field, which deflects some of the radiation that would otherwise hit the space station. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.6	And the Earth itself covers almost half the sky from such a close orbit, effectively blocking all radiation from half the sky and so reducing the astronauts exposure by half. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62085.7	I could come up with other problems, but those are the main ones.
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62086.0	Unmanned probes do not require warmth, food, water, or oxygen. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62086.1	All of these must be included for a manned mission, in sufficient quantities to ensure the survival of the crew. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62086.2	Systems for managing these resources, as well as waste disposal systems, must be included in the spacecraft design. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62086.3	These factors and others make manned missions enormously more difficult than unmanned. 
2N47BKL5PPB5L7E.62086.4	Manned missions to Mars, however, are likely to be enormously more rewarding in terms of scientific discovery than unmanned.
