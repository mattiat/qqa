OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.5998.0	You should start walking, but not by walking a mile per day or so. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.5998.1	Start with running  100 meters, then walk slowly, run 100 meters etc. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.5998.2	Do this for a week, and then run 200 meters...300. and keep building up week after week. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.5998.3	I wouldn t suggest going to the gym, because if your 14 yo, then you re body isn t fully developed, and exercising with weight can damage a body that isn t fully developed. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.5998.4	As for food, try eating bananas, that s the sweetest fruit.

OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.65844.0	You and I are in the same boat. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.65844.1	I was 15, 5 4  and 103 pounds. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.65844.2	Now I m 16, 5 6 and 115. 
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.65844.3	I think you just have to keep practicing.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.0	Good for you!!
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.1	I offer you my standard no-nonsense Mom advice.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.2	    It is not glamorous, but it works and it is what I have my children do.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.3	  (By theway I am a standard no-nonsense former track athlete, former dancer Mom, so I have quite a bit of practical training experience.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.4	):First, you should not undertake any new exercise program until you consult your doctor.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.5	  Your level of fatigue may be normal for someone who has not been exercising at all, or it may indicate a more serious problem.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.6	  Since you have already been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy you must heed this advise.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.7	  After your doctor approves, walking is an excellent way to start your cardiovascular conditioning.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.8	  You or your parent may need to invest in a heart rate monitor (available at any good sporting goods store) so that you do not elevate your hear rate beyond what is safe for you.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.9	  If you walk at a very brisk pace for a couple weeks you will find that you can begin to jog a little with a lot more comfort.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.10	  Soon you will be able to run without having to stop to rest.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.11	  Choose a modest distance, maybe a mile, to begin with.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.12	  Increase your distance not more than 50% per week until you reach a distance of three miles.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.13	  Then, to minimize risk of injury to your feet and legs, increase your distance by not more than 10% per week.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.14	  You are very young and may be able to handle a greater rate of mileage increase.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.15	  Check with your doctor.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.16	  When you begin running remember you will be uncomfortable at first, but your chest should not hurt.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.17	  For strength training push ups are excellent for your upper body.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.18	  If knee push ups are still too difficult for you, you can begin by pushing up from the back of a chair or a counter top.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.19	  For your legs, an easy exercise to do at home is squats.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.20	  Place your feet slightly wider than your shoulders.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.21	  Bend your knees keeping your chin level with the floor.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.22	  As you bend your knees, extend your arms in front of you for balance.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.23	  Try to bend your knees far enough so that your thighs are parallel to the ground (if you can t go this far it is okay).
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.24	  Do as many of these as you can until you feel your legs beginning to fatigue (about 10 to 20).
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.25	  Repeat this three times.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.26	  You will notice your strength improving within two weeks if you do this regularly..You
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.27	You should also include some exercise for your abdominal muscles.  Tummy crunches are easy.  Lay on the floor with your knees bent.  Place your hands behind your head.  Contracting your tummy muscles, raise your head and shoulders off the floor and then lower back down to the floor.  Do as many of these as you can, then repeat three times.  I do not say here how many because you may be able to do only a few.  That is okay.  Remember, you are just starting out..
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.28	Your diet should stay within the daily recommended standards for all food groups.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.29	  The only food you absolutely should eliminate completely from your diet is trans fats.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.30	  They offer no nutritional value and are very bad for your heart.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.31	  If you need to reduce your calorie intake, you should concentrate on reducing fat in your diet while paying careful attention to making sure you consume a proper amount of protein, carbohydrates and a lot of vegetables and fruits.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.32	  For your sweet tooth grapes are good.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.33	  Also, go with your parent to the grocery store and look around the produce section for seasonal fruit that looks interesting.
OM0DSM7AEI0DLD6.71522.34	  My favorites are oranges, grapes, pears, bananas and berries.
