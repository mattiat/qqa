DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.0	Well mikey makes a very valid point and i agree with most all of it.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.1	His recommendation of the proteins is almost correct.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.2	What you really want to make sure of is that you get two kinds of protein..your whey protein which you have in powders you can buy and your caesin protein which is found in dairy and also can be bought in shake form.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.3	Whey protein is a fast acting protein that is delieverd through your body quickly, this i recommend taking the first thing when you wake up with breakfast, and immediately following a workout.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.4	While sleeping the body is in a slowed state that get no nutrients for you are not eating, so when your body is deprived when you wake up you want to get this in you ASAP.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.5	Also when you bodies muscles are fatigued after a workout you want the whey protein to get in quickly to be most effective to your growth.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.6	Now for the caesin protein, Caesin is an equally effective but more slower acting protein.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.7	you want to take this right before bed.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.8	This allows you while your sleeping to induce the protein slowly and provide your body with the needed protein while you are asleep.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.9	I find it very effective to have a glass of Milk and 4 egg whites right before bed.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6925.10	When i started this method I was 170 pounds on November 1st, I am currently as of January 1st 198 pounds which is an increase of 14 pounds a month and i feel great everyday, good luck to you with your diet and football!
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.0	heres what i did 2 gain about 12lbs in a month.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.1	the 1st step u need 2 do is invest in a good protein shake mix.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.2	i recommend musclemilk because it doesnt taste that bad.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.3	what ur gonna do is start eating more than u usually do.but try and keep it healthy.remember this general rule.2 get big u have 2 eat big.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.4	added 2 this increase in calories u should drink 3 protein shakes on days that u lift and 2 on off days.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.5	on days u lift u drink 1 shake an hour b4 ur workout.then u drink the 2nd shake within an hour after ur workout.and u 3rd right b4 u go 2 bed.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.6	on off days u drink 1 shake during the day (whenever u feel like it) and then 1 right b4 u go 2 bed.  
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6926.7	doing this i went from 228lbs 2 240lbs in a little over a month
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.0	add oil to everything (within reason), olive oil is best. it s not heavy so you don t eat less but you do add calories. if you make pasta, cover it in oil before adding sauce, you wont taste the difference. the same can be done with potatoes. i was university athlete and we were given a talk by some of the most esteemed nutritionists in academia every year, and this advice was given to one of my teamates who was told to gain weight for the national team.   
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.1	Protien is the best thing for building muscle mass and the timing of you protein intake is just as important.
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.2	 you say you lift, so make sure you eat protein rich foods along with fat and carbohydrate to help your body repair the damaged tissue and build muscle (performance-wise chocolate milk is the best balance).
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.3	 be careful with supplements, and at 15 i d suggest you stay clear of that.
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.4	 it can get messy, but if you do go that route don t take anything unless you know every ingredient (and they don t always have to put it all on the label so ask someone who knows for help).
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.5	 and check the banned substances list online.
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.6	 try the oil thing first and add natural protiens to your diet and healthy fats.
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.7	 you should also consult a doctor and inform them of your intentions to monitor you health as you alter your body.
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.6927.8	 lift and eat and good luck.
DZLWIZLKGYF5O7D.72703.0	See a dietician for some healthy ways to meet your goal!
