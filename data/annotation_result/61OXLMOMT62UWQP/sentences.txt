61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.0	Exposure to environmental carcinogens of various types is responsible for the development of most bladder cancers. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.1	Tobacco use (specifically cigarette smoking) is thought to cause 50% of bladder cancers discovered in male patients and 30% of those found in female patients. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.2	Thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens such as benzidine. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.3	Certain drugs such as cyclophosphamide and phenacetin are known to predispose to bladder TCC. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.4	Chronic bladder irritation (infection, bladder stones, catheters, bilharzia) predisposes to squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.5	Approximately 20% of bladder cancers occur in patients without predisposing risk factors. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46813.6	Bladder cancer is not currently believed to be heritable (i.e., does not run in families as a consequence of a specific genetic abnormality).Please see the web pages for more details on Bladder cancer.
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46814.0	Smoking inserts hundreds of carcinogenic substances into the body as a whole, increasing cancer risks in general, not just the localised sites you mention. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.46814.1	Transitional cell cancer is the type the bladder is most prone to anyway, it makes up 90% of all bladder cancers.
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.87752.0	Smoking is considered one of the greatest risk factors for bladder cancer. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.87752.1	The risk is probably due to the fact that cancer-promoting substances found in tobacco tend to collect in the urine, and then become concentrated in the bladder while awaiting excretion. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.87752.2	Other chemicals, including aniline dyes, beta-napthylamine, benzadine salts, and mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons also are believed to be cancer-causing agents. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.87752.3	These chemicals are widely used in the rubber, leather, textile, chemical, plastics, petroleum, wood, and paint industries. 
61OXLMOMT62UWQP.87752.4	It may take up to 50 years after the original chemical exposure for bladder cancer to develop
