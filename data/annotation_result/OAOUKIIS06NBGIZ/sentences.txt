OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.0	Ok, technically it really depends what stroke you want to do in the triatalon.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.1	  I m going to assume you want to swim the freestyle or front crawl stroke.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.2	  The breathing doesn t take that much work to get down.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.3	  When you breath, you are going to breath the side by rotating your head to whatever side you would like to.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.4	  I tell the kids when I teach them to swim to pick a side and to stay on that side.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.5	  I breath to the left side because I m left handed.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.6	  So you are going to breath to that side when your hand is ready to come out of the water.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.7	  The head turns to the side you want when your hand comes out of the water you are breathing to.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.8	  The second your hand comes out of the water say on the left hand side, your head will come out on the left hand side.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.9	  Your head stays out while you get a huge breath of air and the second your hand goes around and back in the water your head goes back into the water..Whe
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.10	When your left hand goes up and around (still out of the water) your head is out of the water but when your hand goes back into the water your head goes back into the water.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.11	  Some things to think about.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.12	when your head goes back into the water close your mouth becase you don t want to get water in your mouth and when you pick a side, do not breath to both sides starting out.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.13	  I know when you watch professional or really good swimmers swim front crawl, they breath to both sides, but if you try that when you re starting out swimming you re going to get sick.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.14	  Start out really slowly with the breathing by putting both hands in shallow water on the wall and just go through the motions of the arms and remember the second your hand that you want to breath to that side comes out of the water your head goes to the side keeping your ear in the water chin to your shoulder and take a big breath and the second that hand goes back into the water your face goes back into the water remembering to close your mouth before your head gets into the water.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.28092.15	  I know it seems difficult, but really after practicing it for a while you will get it down and it will be fun.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.0	The most common misconception about swimming is you hold your breath while your face is underwater.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.1	 That s like telling a runner that you can only take in a breath on every 5th stride.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.2	 When swimming you are breathing just as you would any other sport except you have to regulate your breathing.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.3	 While your face is underwater you should be blowing out your air, slowly.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.4	 The 2 main reasons are 1) blowing out underwater helps you to keep your mouth and nose clear of water and 2) it will give you more time to take in air when your face is above the surface of the water..Blo
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.5	Blowing air slowly underwter forces the unwanted water out of your nose and mouth.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.6	 If air is coming out, water can t come in.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.7	 It also helps gives you more time to take in breaths.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.8	 The short time that your face is above the surface of the water, should be spent taking in air.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.9	 When you expel most of your air underwater, you clear your airway and should be able to get a bigger breath of air when your face bareaks the surface.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.10	 If you have to expel your air and take in a breath in that short time you will probably not get a good breath..A d
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.11	A drill that helps is to do a single arm stroke, stroke using your right arm only, then your next set practice only your left side.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.12	 When doing this your body is being leveled off by your kick.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.13	 This way you can take a slower stroke and concentrate on your breathing.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.14	 Watch your head position: your spine should be straight, chin tucked by your shoulder, and concentrate on looking slightly back when your face surfaces.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.15	 Practice breathing on both sides and blowing yur air out.
OAOUKIIS06NBGIZ.79992.16	 A lot of times this helps to keep your body more balanced and you will be able to swim straighter.
