1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.68991.0	If you are willing to take 9 months it s fairly easy to lose weight. 
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.68991.1	Just cut back a little bit on the foods you normally eat. 
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.68991.2	By only cutting back a little, you won t feel deprived, and little by little, over the months you will lose the weight. 
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.68991.3	You can, of course exercise a bit more to help the process. 
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.68991.4	But again, being willing to take the time is a big plus in reaching your lowered weight goal.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.0	Get an exercise plan with a healthy diet.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.1	 The best way to lose fat is to do cardio such as running, or swimming.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.2	 if you want to tune up do so resistance workouts.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.3	 Even if you dont want to tune up do some resistance workout just consintrate more on cardio.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.4	 Look for a plan that works for you.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.5	 A diet plan will make your exersice plan far more efficient here are the basicsThe basics of most nutrition booksDon???t starve yourself.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.6	 That???s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though].
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.7	 The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.8	 Before I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats..Pro
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.9	Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. Carbohydrates [carbs]can be found almost in anything else even apples..
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.10	Good carbs:Apples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat Bad carbs:White bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!!
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.11	Good fats:Avocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter The ratio in your dietvaries but I think a good starting point is something like[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]This can sound meaningless.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.12	 So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned]and you should be okay.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.13	  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.14	 not consecutively].
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.15	 The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories]so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.16	 Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.17	 That???s how the Adkins basically works.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.18	 If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight.
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.19	 I leave to you to decide if this is good you..I w
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.20	I would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry]if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla..
1YFTOXMATJC2DO4.72796.21	You are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don???t exercise].
