IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52149.9	Good luckYou re probably too young to lift weights, so I would suggest running, jogging, and walking for exercise. You could also rollerblade, bike, jump rope. anything that will get your heart pumping..
IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52149.10	Avoid foods that are high in sugars: candy, soda, cookies, and other sweets. Also avoid foods that are high in fats, especially fried foods (like french fries and chicken nuggets from fast food places, and potato chips.) Try not to eat a lot of salty foods..

IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52150.2	 Just realize that healthy weight loss is a slow and gradual process.
IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52150.3	 The best results are obtained by being consistent and patient.
IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52150.4	 Most weight loss programs that produce faster results are not effective in the long run as the weight will be put back on and many times additional weight will also be regained.
IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52150.5	 Just keep in mind that with any weight loss program it is advisable to consult with your doctor or other medical professional such as a professional dietician before beginning any program..PS.
IQLNP0BSVMXYHR2.52150.6	PS.. you didn t say how tall you are which is very important to whether or not you even need to consider dieting. Unless you are very short (like less than 5) you are not overweight and it could be unhealthy for you to lose weight. Ask a doctor or pharmacist for a weight / height comparison chart to show you exactly what your ideal weight should be.
