66AVRHXXTE21OX1.31087.1	I find that what she wants to do is amazing.  
66AVRHXXTE21OX1.31087.2	I would suggest putting something in the newspaper, Put flyers up around your hometown, when school starts you could ask if you could send a flyer home with children, Maybe you could try your local churches.  
66AVRHXXTE21OX1.31087.3	Ask the newspaper to run an article about your daughter wanting to do this. 
66AVRHXXTE21OX1.31087.4	Best of luck to you and Tell your daughter that she is one special girl for wanting to do this.
