3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.16529.0	leafs have chloroplast on tehm most of the time, chloroplast is green and makes the leaf green too. in the winter, the leaves kind of hibernate and stop making chloroplast, since they don t make anymore chloroplast, their real colors show. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.16529.1	The red, brown, yellow colors you see on leavse, are the real colors
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23117.0	Leaves get their green color from chlorophyll, a pigment found in plant leaves that enables them to process sunlight. Fall s shorter days and cooler temperatures cause the chlorophyll to move from the leaves to the branches, trunk, and roots, and the yellow and orange pigments that are always present become visible..
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23117.1	Other chemical processes produce the brilliant reds, purples and bronzes. On warm fall days, sugar is produced in the leaves of some trees and then trapped by the chill of night. As sugar accumulates, the leaves turn brighter red..
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23117.2	Factors that influence the amount of fall color the leaves will wear each year include:    * Rain    * Amount of sugar in the leaves    * Wind    * Temperatures
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23118.0	The color of a leaf results from an interaction of different pigments produced by the plant. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23118.1	The main pigment classes responsible for leaf color are porphyrins, carotenoids, and flavonoids. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23118.2	The color that we perceive depends on the amount and types of the pigments that are present. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23118.3	Chemical interactions within the plant, particularly in response to acidity (pH) also affect the leaf color. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.23118.4	Check : http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa082602a.htm  for a complete list of pigments (and molecular structure) and the colour they produce.
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.0	During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.1	The trees will rest, and live off the food they stored during the summer. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.2	They begin to shut down their food-making factories. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.3	The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.4	As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.5	Small amounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.6	We just can t see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.7	The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.8	In some trees, like maples, glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.9	Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn cause the leaves turn this glucose into a red color. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.10	The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves. 
3UFWPS56HJVHNLI.74411.11	It is the combination of all these things that make the beautiful colors we enjoy in the fall. http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/leaves.htmlGOOD LUCKParadiso
