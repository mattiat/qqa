51QAUFUQ368V0EC.784.0	Marriage is NOT important for the man and the woman. It is just a legal certificate . That piece of paper does not bringLove , trust, Intimacy and Respect..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.784.1	Marriage brings about a certain responsibility  and accountability .A child can be born and that needs to be taken care  of. It is in this that suddenly marriage becomes important. There are countries in the world (europe)  where the state takes care of the child, as if the state is the mother. In such a situation marriage is not considered important in such countries.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.0	Marriage is terribly important..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.1	You may break it, it is another matter..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.2	Marriage brings a man within the ambit of a family life..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.3	It gives a sense of purpose by binding one to certain duties..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.4	It is at times be disastrous, tragic, and painful. But going through it makes a man perfect and he/she gets a slice of life that is vitally important in going ahead and defining a course of life..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.5	If first marriage breaks down one learns from it and tries to make the second one better..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.6	One is ensconced in a life of togetherness and in this state the pain and unfairness of the circumstances become bearable. One shares moments of happiness and tragedy and this adds a new dimension to perfection and tolerance. The procreation is another important aspect of married life..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.7	Only a happy couple can provide all the love and care that a new born needs and till the child becomes adult..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.8	If marriage proves to be a failure you become a philosopher and if it becomes successful you taste the nectar of God..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.12648.9	Or, conversely, it is like a laddu(fudge) of Delhi; if you eat you regret it and if you don t eat you regret it.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40561.0	well, depends on wheather its love marriage or arranged one.if its arrange marriage its important to make ur family happy,and if its love marriage its important to make ur galfriend happy..as simple as dat..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.0	Spouses not only image the love of God with in the Trinity;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.1	 they also image the love between God and all humanity, made visible in the love of Christ and the Church.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.2	  By virtue of their Baptisms, the marriage of Christians is a sacrament.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.3	  That means it???s a living sign that truly communicates and participates in the union of Christ the Church.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.4	  The marriage vows lived out in the spouses??? ???One Flesh??? union constitutes this living sign.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.5	  Paraphrasing St.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.6	 Paul:  For this reason a man will leave father and mother and cling to his bride, and the two shall become one flesh.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.7	  This is a profound mystery, and it refers to Christ and the Church<Eph 5:31-32>.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.8	  Christ left his Father in heaven.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.9	  He left the home of his mother on earth - to give up his body for his Bride (Catholic Church) so that we might become ???one flesh??? with him.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.10	  Where do we become ???one flesh??? with Christ?
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.11	  Most specifically in the Eucharist.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.12	  The Eucharist is the sacramental consummation of the marriage between Christ and the Church.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.13	  And when we receive the body of our heavenly Bridegroom into our own, just like a bride we conceive new life in us - God???s very own life.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.14	  As Christ said, ???Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you???  (Jn 6:53).
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.15	Since the ???one flesh??? communion of man and wife foreshadowed the Eucharistic communion of Christ and the Church right from the beginning, John Paul II speaks of marriage as the ???Primordial Sacrament.???  Let???s pause for a moment to let this reality sink in.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.16	  Of all the ways that God chooses to reveal his life and love in the created world, John Paul II is saying, marriage - enacted and consummated by sexual union - is the most fundamental.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.17	  St.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.18	 Paul wasn???t kidding when he said this is a ???profound mystery.???  Could God have made our sexuality any more important than this?
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.19	  Any more beautiful?
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.20	  Any more glorious?
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.21	  God gave us sexual desire itself to be the power to love as he loves, so that we could participate in the divine life and fulfill the very meaning of our being and existence..Sou
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.22	Sounds great you say, but it???s a far cry from the way sex play itself out in the experience of real human beings.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.23	  Yes, it is.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.24	  The historical abuse of women at the hands of men;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.25	 the tragedy of rape and other heinous sex crimes, even against children;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.26	 AIDS and a host of other sexually transmitted diseases;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.27	 unwed mothers; ???fatherless??? children;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.28	 abortion;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.29	 adultery;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.30	 skyrocketing divorce rates;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.31	 prostitution;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.32	 a multibillion-dollar pornography industry;
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.33	 the general cloud of shame and guilt that hangs over sexual matters - all of this paints a very different picture from the one St.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.34	 Paul and John Paul II give us..The
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40562.35	The picture it paints, in fact, is the tragedy of human sinfulness and our fall from God???s intention for our sexuality ???in the beginning???.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40563.0	So you both can get half of everything when it doesn t work out.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.40564.0	In the absence of a secure and sustainable arrangements implemented by the society - a marriage provides an alternative means in which a man and a woman promise one another to take care of one another for life and safeguard all of their common interests.
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.53727.0	The sanctity of marriage is important because it is the foundationof  family values - which we are now slowly losing..
51QAUFUQ368V0EC.53727.1	Sad, but that s the Truth..
