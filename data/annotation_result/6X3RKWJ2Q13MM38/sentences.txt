6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45384.0	Is your mom lucid at this point?  
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45384.1	This is her decision.  
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45384.2	If she wants a second opinion then go to a local family practitioner and ask for a referral to another doctor. 
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45384.3	If she wants an alternative practitioner because the local doctors have given up then call some chiropractors in your area for a referral to a good one there.  
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45384.4	But when all is said and done, this is Mom s decision, not yours.  
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45384.5	She needs to make these choices.
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45385.0	It would help to know what type and stage cancer she has and what state she is located in. Also whether or not she has good health insurance..
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45385.1	For example - if she lives in Texas and has lymphoma I d call the lymphoma clinic at MD Anderson and see about getting a second opinion at a top of the line hospital. If she was in Illinois, I d go to Northwestern, in California go to Stanford or City of Hope or UCLA.  Pick the largest major cancer center in her area and see about getting her a second opinion. This might mean a review of her current medical records or physically transferring her to the other hospital for further testing..
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45385.2	Make sure and only get referrals to top level hospitals.
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45385.3	 You only want referrals for realistic treatment options and not just anywhere willing to do needless surgery.
6X3RKWJ2Q13MM38.45385.4	 Sometimes the Drs are right about there being no other options.
