6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.27783.0	It s a decision to be happy. 
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.27783.1	A choice you have the option of making everyday.
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.0	Since this IS in the philosophy section, I suppose I ll provide a philosophical answer.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.1	Throughout the ages, the desire to be happy, and attaining that desire, has changed.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.2	I ll provide a very, very, brief history of philosophy and let you select the best idea.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.3	In the ancient era, the main philosophers believed in eudaimonistic ethics.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.4	In very short, this is a fancy way of saying that if you do virtuous and good things, that you will be happy; and conversely, if you do vicious and bad things, you will be miserable.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.5	Now, they say that being virtuous does not GUARANTEE happiness, but sets the only possible conditions for actually being happy.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.6	This line of thought continued through the Islamic ages and into the Age of Faith.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.7	However, more and more Christians were starting to believe that you can never attain ultimate happiness on earth.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.8	From this, they started to shift and believe that happiness could only be attained upon unification with God, which entailed that one must both believe in God and follow His will.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.9	With the Enlightenment and the Reformation, along with the need to break free from the authority of the Church, happiness takes a backseat to freedom.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.10	The main idea in these ages is that one must be absolutely free, emancipated from everything, in order to be happy.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.11	Hence, the revolutionary wars and the major idea to limit the power of governments.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.12	I think happiness becomes more ambiguous at this time period though and/or more relativized.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.13	Even the Declaration of Independence states that we are not entitled to happiness, but the PURSUIT of happiness, which means either they did not know what happiness was, or that they knew it was different for everyone.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.14	Anyways, moving into the postmodern ages, a desire for aesthetics and beauty creeps back into our social needs.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.15	With this desire, so the maxim that beauty is goodness (the reverse of the ancient maxim that goodness is beauty) comes into play.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.16	For the main ideas in postmodern thought is a semi-relativization of happiness, since it is tied into your perception of the beautiful.  
6CNWHIWWU1YZKKQ.79678.17	Anyways, I hope this isn t too long and this helps.
