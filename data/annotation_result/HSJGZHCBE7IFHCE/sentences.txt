HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.14261.2	just being there, loving her and helping around the house is great.  
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.14261.3	sounds like you are already helping her.

HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.14261.5	what your mom is going thru is hard and she needs to be sad  sometimes.  
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.14261.6	just take care of each other.
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.40934.0	Try your best to comfort your mother. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.40934.1	Let her know that your there for her and try not to argue with her at times. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.40934.2	It can cause her to stress out. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.40934.3	Spend alot of time with her and that will make herhappy :)hope i have helped!
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.0	Lol, I start to laugh because my teacher just told us about how she got breast cancer. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.1	She told her story of how she went to the doctor and got the bad news. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.2	She said she waited 2 days before telling anyone. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.3	I had to think about how I was going to tell everyone and I had to compose myself so that I won t look a wreck, She said. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.4	I started thinking of all the positive things about having breast cancer. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.5	Doing the most teacher-like thing, I started a list of the positives of breast cancer. 1) No more bras and underwire 2) I ll have to go get chemo but then my hair will probably fall out and I WONT have to worry about fixing my hair everyday. 3) Everybody will feel sorry for me so i ll get it
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.6	easy around the house (maybe I can get the kids to clean their rooms now, and even get my husband to take me to a restaurant) 4) I may be able to get breast reconstruction and get the breasts I ve always wanted (I can blame the breast cancer, and say its my reason for getting it) 5) Chemo? 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.7	Doesn t that make you loose weight? 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.8	Great now i ll lose those thunder thighs I have and my kangaroo pouch. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.9	She probably had more on her list but she said after she finished it she was actually somewhat looking forward to it and at least accepted it and was ok with it. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.10	She said on the 3rd day she told her people, her husband was shocked, horrified, scared, everything you would expect.....he couldn t believe she was sooo happy! 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.11	Well, she is sooo fine now and you wouldn t beleive she ever had it. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.12	She has beautiful brown hair, unfortunately she gained all the weight back and a few more (I wouldn t say it to her face lol) but she is great! 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.13	Well at least to me she looks healthier then before. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.14	I hope this helped. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.15	For whatever reason, God decides to give us challenges in life and you don t have to meet that challenge 100% you just have to put up a fight. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.16	You have to keep going and with people like you with her fighting all the way ..I m sure she ll do just fine. 
HSJGZHCBE7IFHCE.86115.17	Good luck to you and your family.
