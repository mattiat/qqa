4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.0	Hello Payton,You ve gotta look at his as a new lease on life.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.1	  You are through the worst part, being the surgery.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.2	  Now that you are aware that you have a predispositin to heart disease, you need to adopt a strategy to prevent it from recurring until perhaps you are a ripe old age.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.3	  And with diet and liftstyle modicfications you can do just that.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.4	  Dr.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.5	 Dean Ornish has done extensive research on preventing and reversing heart disease, and he has published several books on the subject.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.6	  He claims that heart disease can be prevented, and in many cases slowly reversed.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.7	  He has many clinical studies to back up his claims.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.8	  He is basically advocating a very low fat (less than 10%) no cholesterol vegetarian diet, regular moderate exercise, and finding ways to control the stress issues in your life.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.9	  This is not easy to do, but it can be done.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.10	  Most  people do not have the will power to make such dynamic changes in there lives for the long term, which is why this plan is not prescribed by many physicians.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.11	  One of the previous posts indicated that cholesterol was not a factor in heart disease, which is incorrect.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.12	  Cholesterol is just one of many contributing factors that contribute to CAD, so it should be controlled..As 
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.13	As adults, we are all walking around with some degree of blockages in our coronary arteries.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.14	  CAD starts in childhood and progresses as weage, faster in some individuals than others.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.15	  At this point and time, you are starting with a clean slate, and can rest assured in the knowledge that you have survived a bypass operation and can now reap the benefits, being remarkably better blood flow to you heart.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.16	  Millions of people are walking around with cad and don t even know it.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.17	  Your much better off than them, as you are aware of your cad and can now take the steps necessary to improve your cardiac health.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.18	  Knowledge is power.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.19	  Educate yourself.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.20	  Read the Dr.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.21	 Dean Ornish books.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.22	  Adopt what he advocates into your life.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.23	  You absolutley can go on to live a normal life span if you are willing to make the sacrifices to do so.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.24	  It s well worth it.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.25	  You can do it!
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.26	      By adopting this lifestyle to manage your CAD, you will take charge of this disease.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.27	  You will be in control, not the disease.
4UWPVI7CY8R2K7V.35756.28	  It will empower you to take back control of your life, and lose that dreadful sense of impending doom that I believe you are feeling.
