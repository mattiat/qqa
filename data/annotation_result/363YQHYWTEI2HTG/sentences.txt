363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24012.0	That s why they call it a pressure cooker instead of a depressure cooker.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.0	what temperature actually does to cook food is to break bonds in the food, and cause other chemical reactions to take place.  Changing the pressure does the same thing, meaning it needs a lower temperature to produce the same effect in the food.  It would be the same thing as making the temperature super hot, but with no burning..
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.1	An easier example for how pressure gives these effects is in states of matter.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.2	 such as, water freezes at 0 degrees celcius, but that is only at 1atm of pressure.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.3	  The more you increase the pressure, the easier water would freeze.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.4	  water might even freeze at 10 degrees celcius or higher if it was under enough pressure.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.5	 The same with gas and liquid, if you take water vapor at say 110 degrees celcius and put it under pressure, it will turn to liquid.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.6	  This is because the molecules of water are getting pushed closer together,causing a gas to be a liquid easier or a liquid to be a solid easier.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.7	  So if you decrease the pressure, (like in a pressure cooker) the reverse would happen.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.8	  There wouldn t be as much pressure, so the particles would be more free to move around.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.9	  so water wouldn t freeze as easily.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.10	  All temperature does is speed up the particles, so with less pressure, they can move around more freely and change states more easily to looser states..The
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.24013.11	The same thing is happening in the pressure cooker, due to a lower pressure, the molecules of food can move around more easily and the bonds can break, and basically lower temperatures have the same effect as higher temperatures would with more pressure.  So it has the same effect as making the food much much hotter, only without burning the food because there s not as much heat involved.
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.75306.0	A pressure cooker works by keeping the steam generated by the boiling liquid water from leaving the container (by using a weight over a vent).  
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.75306.1	This builds up the pressure inside the vessel.  
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.75306.2	The pressure forces the liquid to need a higher temperature to boil.  
363YQHYWTEI2HTG.75306.3	Higher temperatures and moving steam cook the food faster.
