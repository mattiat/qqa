1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.0	Listen to beetles advice..
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.1	I went throught bear safety training as I work as a wildlife biologist and worked up in the artctic in Alaska..his advice is basically what we were told.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.2	  In addition if the bear actually approaches you or charges you..still stand your ground.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.3	  Many times they will not actually come in contact with you, they will charge, almost touch you than run away.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.4	  If a bear actually makes contact with you, lay on the ground on your stomach with hands over head.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.5	  DO NOT SCREAM or yell, this will make the attack worse.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.6	  Some bears will attack for a minute of two than fun away.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.7	  If the attack continues for longer than 2 minutes (not that you d be in ANY condition to keep track of time at this point!).then and only then are you to roll over facing the bear and fight back!!  I know these instructions sound kind of crazy but these
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9208.8	are litgitimate insturctions from experts that keep hikers and oil drillers in bear country alive!!  Do carry bear mace with you, and keep it readily available, wear on your hip on a belt, and make noise while hiking so you don t surprise anyone!!
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9837.0	all depends on wot kind of beargrizzla bears wont attack if u play dead while brown bears will run away if u stand tall and make a noisesome bears can climb trees toofind out wot kind of bear it is and check out some proper websiteif its a teddy bear i woodnt worry too much
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9838.0	Don t shoot bears, mean person. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.9838.1	A stun gun will do the trick
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.0	you should walk through the woods, talking, or making noise if at all possible, this will alert the bear to your presence.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.1	 Most bears are instinctively scared of humans, so letting them know you are there is a safe way to avoid scaring them and provoking an attack.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.2	 Should you come face to face with a bear, you should slowly walk away from it, dont turn and run, this will make it attack you.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.3	 Walk backwards with your head slightly to the side, so you can see where you are going, and talk to the animal good bear  nice bear .
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.4	Bear sprays are also available at most hunting and fishing supply stores, it is basically pepper spray, and apparently works very well at keeping bears at bay..Peo
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.5	People! bears are scavengers, they will eat you if you are dead anyways, plus they can tell you are alive, the only reason in the odd case that they leave you alone is becasue they ralize that they have proven to you that they are dominant, thats all, if they wanted to kill you, lying dead or not, they would!!
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32149.6	Hope this helps!
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32150.0	One approach might be to lie prone on the ground showing your belly- the bear will supposedly accept this as a sign of submission and walk off. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32150.1	If the bear is particularly hungry or sick though, you will still be in trouble. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32150.2	Of course, perhaps the surest protection would be not to go into the mountains at all. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32150.3	Care to reconsider your trip?
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32151.0	id just give it a lil wink and smile and its sure to stop dead in its tracks, then start to walk up to it slowly wiggling ur hips and telling it what a handsome bear it is and start to tickle its belly and I m sure u will have a new friend. simple see, but mmmmmm maybe that will only work on the male bears mmmmm but its worth a try isn t it lol
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.0	Black bears? 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.1	or Grizzly bears? 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.2	The actions you should take are different based on the type of bear. for example adult Grizzlies can t climb trees, but Black bears can even when adults. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.3	If you come across a Black bear or Grizzly you should probably not turn your back and run because that might make them chase you, instead you should face the bears direction without making direct eye contact and back away slowly until the bear is out of sight. most times a Black bear will run away if it sees a human and if they attack, best thing to do is fight back as best as you can. and if a black bear charges you stand your ground and dont run it will trigger thier hunting instincts. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.4	Climbing a tree to escape a black bear is pointless because they can climb very well.  
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.5	With a Grizzly your best bet is to back up to a large tree and climb it, keeping in mind it better be a pretty sturdy tree because they are powerful animals capable of knocking a smaller tree over. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.6	They can not climb in general as thier claws are longer and not semi-retractable like a Black bears claws. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.7	I truly disagree with the whole play dead approach because both Grizzlies and Black bears are oppurtunistic animals and will feed on carrion as well as kill and eat animals.although Black bears are much more scavenger like and tend not to kill to eat as much as they just look around for scraps. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.8	Grizzlies on the other hand are very accomplished hunters and will take down large prey animals when they want. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.9	Black bears are much less predatory and are less likely to chase after and try to kill a running animal but they can and running triggers that instinct. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.10	So in all honesty your best bet is to stand your ground and back away.. don t run for either type of bear becausethat will make them want to chase you! 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.11	I have lived in the wilderness of Northern Canada for many years and I can honestly say that Black bears are not at all likely to attack you in most cases they run away as soon as they see or smell a human, the only places where Black bears are agressive is in parks with visitors that feed them, everywhere else the bears know that usually humans shoot them and so fear us. 
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.32152.12	Grizzlies are far more agressive as far as I have heard (having no direct experience of them) because they hunt much more and are far larger animals that truly do not fear much of anything at all..
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50556.0	Great questionI have done alot of trekking through California, Montana and Wyoming and have met Black bears (which are quite dinky and placid but can go nuts if they have babies), and have been half an hour away from (allegedly) the mother of all grizzley s whilst on a trail through Glacier National park - so some other trekkerers told me..
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50556.1	What the park wardens say is SING, SHOUT, MAKE NOISE.do it loudly, let them know you are there..they will get out of the way, it is a surprised bear wot will go mental and rip your little legs off..No fun permission: anything that will confuse them and stop them in their tracks..
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50556.2	I have been told be an native american buddy that to keep a bottle of perfume in your pocket.throw it at the ground near your feet and make the place stink: they have good noses, them bears, and a mega concentrated dose of Britney Spears Obsessive Compulsive is gonna give em something to think about..
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50556.3	Have you got a rape alarm? Def take that.you only need to distract them for a second then they will lose interest..Stick to the trails is the most important thing, and talk to everyone you see when trekking: make sure others know where you are.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50557.0	you stop your breath because bear are not eat a dead people.
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50558.0	Bears attack people because the bears are startled (put a bell on your pack as you hike, they will hear you coming and go the other direction); they are protecting their young (never get between a sow and her cubs!)
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50558.1	; they are territorial (back away slowly and do not make eye contact); they are hungry (do not keep food in your tent.  
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50558.2	Also, they can be attracted to your scent, including during menstrual cycle).  
1UL1IDV7VT5MNDE.50558.3	If you are attacked, DO NOT run; play dead and pray.
