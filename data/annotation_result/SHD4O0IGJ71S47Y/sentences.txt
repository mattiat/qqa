SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.1	 You really need to ask your physician what his guidelines are about use of vitamins.
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.2	 Put some blueberries and broccoli in your diet regularly.
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.3	 Lab rats fed blueberries had a longer life span than with any other food tested.
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.4	 Also apples, oranges and strawberries.
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.5	 Bright colors in raw foods generally mean lots of antioxidant vitamins.
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.6	 Fruit yogurt smoothies are always good.
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.7	 The live yogurt can get your digestive system working correctly plus you can add protein powder, vitamins and various fruits as you see fit for a delicious easy to drink smoothie..If 
SHD4O0IGJ71S47Y.89191.8	If you need to buy supplements, then you might try buying supplements by mail order or on line from companies like Vitamin Shoppe  www.vitaminshoppe.com  or Swanson s vitamin  www.swansonvitamins.com   Both companies have a huge inventory of products at big discounts plus you can avoid the extra high costs associated  with purchases made from multi level marketers claiming to have some secret cancer curing formula.  good luck
