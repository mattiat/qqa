PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21885.0	workout! 
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21885.1	you dont have to diet to have muscle tone however if there is too much ecess fat covering the stomach area it might not show. this also takes time to do so dont give up in a week. dieting will most likely help your results tho so i would recoment eating healthy and working out esp. in the AM hours this will also help to boost your matabolizm oh and eat brekfast!
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.0	well, dieting is esentially what it is.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.1	especially if you already have the abs but the fat covers it.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.2	But, if they dont show well because your abs arent that big, then you can change your excercises.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.3	I will teach you the best stomach excercise in the world.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.4	Not everybody can do it.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.5	Only very strong people.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.6	but, to attempt to do one and not being able to do it is a good start.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.7	I once had a 6 pack doing about 1 minute a day with this.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.8	So, all that crap on tv is bull.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.9	Ive been a kung fu master for 13 years.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.10	You can email me at fudope_7@yahoo.com for pictures of my abs.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.11	But, here goes. 
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.12	First you lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.13	Then you move your feet into push up position.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.14	Now you will stretch your hands far out.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.15	Make sure that your hands are far out, but they touch teach other.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.16	So, from top to bottom, its your hands, then you, then your feeet.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.17	Now, try to do a pushup in that position.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.18	Keep your back straight.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.19	If you push your body up but your back is bent, you are only doing half the work.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.20	Your body has to be straight.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.21	I used to do as much as I wanted until I got tired.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.22	The very best person did about 30.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.23	I used to do about 50+.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.24	You can do about 10 to 20 of these a night and it will only take you about a minute or two.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.25	After a couple of weeks, you have your 6 pack.  
PJZLPANYDUGQ7G4.21886.26	Far better then any stupid gadget you get on  tv.
