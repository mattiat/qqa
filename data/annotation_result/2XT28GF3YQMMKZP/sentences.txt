2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.0	Okay, so I m a zoologist and a behaviorist and I can tell you that your going about your dream in the wrong way.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.1	  First, if you really want to work with wolves hands on, you should plan on losing your hands.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.2	  Wolves are wild animals and although social and attentive to humans, they really don t read human behavior all that well.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.3	  Second, it s not healthy for a wolf for humans to get too close or handle it at all.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.4	  If you really care about the animal and not yourself, than you should give up that part of your dream quickly or work with wolves in a captive setting.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.5	if you want to be a wildlife photographer, than be a wildlife photographer.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.6	  But scientists don t necessarily go about taking pretty pictures of animals.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.7	  They may take pictures to identify them or for various other reasons, but scientists write for National Georgraphic, and photographers work with the scientists..Sec
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.8	Second, the way you are going, you will never get into the necessary graduate program.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.9	  If you have an interest in animal behavior, then you study animal behavior and study animals that are appropriate to solving you theoretical dilema.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.10	  Any legitimate researcher would shy away from a person like you because you are really not interested in the topic.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.11	  You are interested in the glory.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.12	  If you really want to study animals, then find somebody who s research leaves you absolutely breathless, and then do all you can to work with that person.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.6615.13	  Hopefully you will learn these things along the way.
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.0	Well, get good grades in high school, get on the college track program in high school.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.1	Go to the University of Florida and get in to the School of Forest Resources and Conservation.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.2	Get your BS, and maintain about a 3.5 GPA.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.3	Cause you need to get in to graduate school.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.4	You ll need to find a grad school that has a program that includes wolf research.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.5	That would be out in the northwestern USA or Canada.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.6	Forget all the crap you see on TV.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.7	Most of it is not made by biologist.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.8	Hands on it NOT the way we biologist get to do most of our work.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.9	Hands on is actually not cool when working with certain species.  
2XT28GF3YQMMKZP.66921.10	The presence of humans is a deterrent to the natural behavior of a wild animal.
