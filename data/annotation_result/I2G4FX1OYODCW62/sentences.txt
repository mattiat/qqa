I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.0	denial is one of the stages of grief. it is normal. it has only been a week! 
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.1	you should be calling as much as you want, im sure your dad and sisters are having similar feelings.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.2	 meybe you could go spend some time at home with your family and all of you could talk about her and tell stories.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.3	 maybe make a memorial or some sort of tribute so that you can really acknowledge her.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.4	 if she had a favorite place (like a particular park or beach or a lake) you could go there either as a family or alone.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.5	 it sounds weird but talk to your mom (or write) it might make you feel better and she can hear you.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.6	 i am really sorry for your loss.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.7	i just have to add that if your husband has already lost support of you in the time when you need him most then there is something seriously wrong with him.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.8	 take all the time you need.
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84323.9	 if you move on too fast it the grief will just come up in the future
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84324.0	Yes. It is a pitiable condition.  I quite understand your mental stage and sorrow due to demise of your mother. What to do. All of us who have come to this world have to go back (I do not know where) one day or other. The end is most expected and we have to bear the loss. The agony, sorrow and loneliness felt by the near and that too dear one is something can not be explained. But the truth remains one day you have to bear this loss. Now it had come to you..
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84324.1	Now it is high time you should divert your attention and mind in other directions and try to relax. It is impossible to forget the departure but you can involve yourself in other activities and divert your attention to some other serious things in life/future. This will bring you some relief and the time will cure you..
I2G4FX1OYODCW62.84324.2	I would suggest you to practice meditation very often now and this will help you to over come the troublesome situation. There are very good books available about meditation and you can buy one and practice. Best of luck.
