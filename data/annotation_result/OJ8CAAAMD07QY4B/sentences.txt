OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.39121.2	This poor woman has been so sick, and the cancer has turned up in other parts of her body as well.  
OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.39121.3	She has to go every month for CT scans, blood work, and pet scans.  
OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.39121.4	At the first discovery of this horrible disease, they gave her a 5% survival rate.  
OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.39121.5	With the help of family and friends, she has survived, but with great difficulty.

OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.39121.11	It isn t easy, and it seems as though everyone you talk to has cancer themselves or someone in their family has it.

OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.85565.0	It s an epidemic, and the American people IMHO have had the wool pulled over there eyes, being led to believe there s nothing you can do to help your chances of not getting cancer..
OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.85565.1	Avoiding the terrible chemicals in our foods, cleaning products, pesticides etc. etc.  would be a great first step, along with eating the right way.  Unfortunately some people think eating diet foods with Splenda or equal is healthy, yet it s nothing but another chemical..
OJ8CAAAMD07QY4B.85565.2	We need to understand the business of curing cancer is nothing but just that, a business .
