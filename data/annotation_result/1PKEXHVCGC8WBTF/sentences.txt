1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85872.0	Because there is many forms of love..

1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85872.3	But learn to live with it..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85872.4	Love will make you growLove oneself before you love others..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85872.5	How can one love someone right if they don t know how to love oneself??
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85872.6	Only you know the answer.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85873.0	I m reading Alain de Botton s Essays In Love , it is categorized a novel written in topics with numbers for each. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85873.1	Surprisingly, your query rings true regarding love since we can understand how we sometime are happy with rosy environment but, indeed, we also are bitter with a dim world around us due to love. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85873.2	I think, one of the reasons is concerned with how we expect from such love, in other words, if we treat love as something more reasonable than romantic, we would feel happy with it. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85873.3	In contrast, if we treat love as something more romantic than reasonable, we would be in a trap of unhappiness since we tend to apply emotion instead of reason and conflicts between those two in love are soon looming and quarrels start. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85873.4	That s the beginning of weeping with sorrow, with disappointment from that too ideal love .
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85874.0	Love with attachment gives pain as well as pleasure. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85874.1	Develop a detached love which means love for whole humanity, with no expectation from them alone will not give any pain. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85874.2	You need to develop that detachment with a lot of practise.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85875.0	Sona,  if you are a computer savvy person it is easy to understand in that language. When there is  Fear there is an instant memory Recall of pain . Some times back , something had pained you so much on some issue and you were not able to bear it..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85875.1	In the present instance of Love, you may be loving this experience so much that you would like this to continue for ever. But, at the same time, you think What if this Love suddenly fails? This fear of losing Love instantly creates the  memory recall of pain within you..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85875.2	So, actually, it is only the fear.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.0	Love considered as the sex act and feelings surrounding that is why it can give pain. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.1	Love is much more than a feeling it is an act of good will toward someone or something. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.2	In this sense you can love your enemies even though you emotionally hate them by acting toward them kindly. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.3	Love is not even categorized as a primary emotion in those psychology texts I have read; instead depression, fear, anger, surprise, disgust and joy are the six emotions we are said to be born with. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.4	All other emotions are learned. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.5	One should not let ones emotions control him or her but use your rational will to act. 
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85876.6	When we rely on an emotion to guide us we open ourselves to pain.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.0	Because we misunderstand what love is..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.1	A long time ago I thought that love was something that you reserved for some special set of people that you had judged worthy of it.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.2	 After a while I got to thinking about what Jesus had said about turning the other cheek and loving our neighbor I put the two together and realized that he had made no exceptions in these statements.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.3	 It became obvious to me that he intended that we exclude no one from the love that we are supposed to be giving.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.4	 I started thinking about my idea of love and suddenly realized that I had not been loving anyone at all.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.5	 I had simply been judging everyone and every thing..Jud
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.6	Judging someone worthy of love is not love, it is only judgment. I actually started to cry when I realized this. I saw just how much of my life I had wasted being judgmental, thinking of myself as a Christian, when I was actually doing just the opposite of what Jesus had asked us to do..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.7	I thought about the verse judge not lest ye be judged, and I understood it for the first time..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.8	I realized that I have a lot of catching up to do.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.9	 So many opportunities were wasted.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.10	 I now try to apply the love that I have for the world in a universal way like Jesus asks us to do.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.11	 If I start to feel afraid and think that I see someone that I should not love because of something I have thought or heard I try to catch my mistake as soon as possible.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.12	 I tell myself that I have forgot the truth and have fallen for the same old trick that had cost me so many opportunities to be loving in the past.
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.13	 The horror of this realization is often all that is necessary to bring me back to my senses and make me drop the judgmental nonsense I was thinking..I s
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.14	I still have a lot to learn about love, but at least I???m making progress..
1PKEXHVCGC8WBTF.85877.15	Love and blessings Your brother don
