SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.18195.0	did you go to the  doctor, and take medication. try to plan all your day, don t sit alone. and i don t know what religion you are, but i am Muslim and i know many people become better after reading holly quran, especially Surat bakara, every day. take care, i will pray for you.
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.0	All I can do is provide my standard post, and urge you to view sections 2, and 1, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris See depression treatments, at ezy-build *(below) in section 2, and consult a doctor, to eliminate thyroid problems, etc. as possible contributing factors: also seek a referral to a therapist using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.1	It is your decision, and yours alone, as to whether to take any antidepressants offered, but, before you do, read section 1, and check medications out at www.drugs.com so you will be on the lookout for side effects, like sexual dysfunction. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.2	My strong recommendation, however, is to follow the advice of my doctor, his associate, and also Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN NP, and  Dr. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.3	Mercola, as well, at http://www.mercola.com and avoid antidepressants (pages 2V, and 2Z refer,&antidepressant websites: page 2). 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.4	The reasons why we all share the same view on this are explained in full, as you will find, if you read the whole section. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.5	All of their advice, (except prayer, because many people are not religious) I have incorporated into the core treatments , including others as options, such as the supplements: Inositol, or SAMe, or herbal remedies, like St. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.6	John s wort. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.7	If you are diagnosed with clinical (major) depression, antidepressants may be necessary for a while, which will give the treatments time to become effective. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.8	The antidepressants themselves need at least several days, or even  weeks to begin becoming effective. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.9	It s a good idea to taper off them slowly, with medical advice, after  several months, say, to a couple of years, at most, because they are only effective in the long term for about 30% of people. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.10	Because of this, you would be well advised to begin the treatments immediately, and maintain them. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.11	I d just thank your mental health care provider, and pocket the prescription, trying the treatments for a few months, to see if they are sufficient for you, before considering filling it (unless clinically depressed, and having great difficulty functioning, or suicidal, in which case I d take them).                                                                                                                
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.12	If the amount of daylight you have been exposed to recently has reduced, perhaps due to the change of seasons, see Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) in section 2, at * http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and, instead of taking 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily; replace 2 of them with cod liver oil supplements for the winter months only! 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.13	(or, as probably a better alternative to the 2 cod liver oil supplements: 1 teaspoonful of cod liver oil, with a little butter, to ensure its use; I take mine on sourdough rye bread, or toast, covered with fishpaste, and pepper, to mask the strong taste).  
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.59785.14	Consider having your doctor test your vitamin D levels.

SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.66437.0	You could help by listening to the person who is depressed. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.66437.1	Start your conversation with open ended questions then allow the person to verbalize his/her feelings freely and to what extent he/she want to share to you. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.66437.2	Refrain from being judgmental. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.66437.3	You might also want to encourage him/her to perform relaxation techniques or doing things that might divert his/her attention from his/her problems. 
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.66437.4	But closely monitor him/her because people who are depressed atfirst then all of a sudden became happy is bound to lead to suicidal tendencies.
SFJ5IYPGUMY7Y1E.71541.0	it actually depends on why the person is depressed.
