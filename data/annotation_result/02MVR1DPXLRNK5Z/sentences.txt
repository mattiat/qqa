02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39118.1	Seriously, the combination of the caffeine and the syrup does a wonder.  
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39118.2	Don t get a mocha, it only works with the flavored syrups, and I d recommend at least a double shot.  
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39118.3	I m not kidding.  
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39118.4	Try it.  
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39118.5	If it doesn t works all you re out is a $3 drink and you didn t have to stick anything up your rear end.

02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.1	  Start eating more foods from the fruit and vegetable group and things should begin to improve.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.2	  Eating a great deal of red meat and fast foods is not good for the digestion of foods and moving them along the intestinal track.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.3	  In order to have a good way of getting rid of waste products from the body eating fiber, having  regular eating habits, lots of fruits and vegetables without over eating and avoiding junk foods is necessary.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.4	  I also believe that alcoholic consumption should be limited despite what all of the magazines report as being good to have a drink a day.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.5	  If you drink then for every drink consumed containing alcohol then drink one containing orange juice, water or milk.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.6	  Treat your body well and it will treat you the same way.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.7	  Abuse your body and expect abuse from it.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.8	  It can be that simple.
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.9	  God created us with a free will and a  perfect body, it is we who make the choices on how we should use those gifts..Goo
02MVR1DPXLRNK5Z.39119.10	Good luck and good eating.
