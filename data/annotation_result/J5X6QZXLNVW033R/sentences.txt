J5X6QZXLNVW033R.6534.0	let me guess. you haven t reached maturity yet, and you are anxious to grow up.it s not a matter, of just-the-weights.  
J5X6QZXLNVW033R.6534.1	it takes .proper..diet as well as knowing how to .properly.lift weights.  
J5X6QZXLNVW033R.6534.2	there IS/ARE certain methods NOT approved to do, or you CAN and WILL cause more harm than good.now..as to your question.........proper weight lifting takes time. and it isn t about pressing 500 pounds every day.it s about moving-up slow and easy. start out with maybe 100 pounds if you can do it..or less..and build up your stamina...for a time, and slowly graduate to bigger weights...inside all this..NEVER do it alone. always have a spotter/team mate.and do this under doctor s care.good luck.
