DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.6	 If your skin is the oily kind, you do not need to apply any moisturizer, your skin oils are enough to keep it hydrated.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.7	 If you really must apply a gentle light oil free one.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.8	 Cetaphil?? Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 or Cetaphil?? Moisturizing Lotion is quite goodApply pimple cream to the acne area.

DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.11	 Don t pick poke scrub or pop your pimples unless you want scars which are really ugly.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.12	 Scrubbing cleansers or washes are also no-nos because it equals picking and poking and makes acne worse Treated pimples gently..Eat

DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.24	If all else fails and your acne is still very bad, it is time to see a dermatologist.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.25	 The pills and medications do work but you may have to take them long term to suppress the acne as it is not a cure and acne is a chronic disease.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.26	 However the pills are not miracles and you won???t see results in 2-3 days.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.27	 It normally takes about 2 weeks to see the difference.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.28	 However not all dermatologists prescribe pills unless your acne is really bad.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.29	 The pills will include antibiotics, accutane and contraceptives.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.30	 If your acne isn???t that bad, dermatologists will prescribe topical creams first.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63782.31	 If you are really going to a dermatologist, I suggest asking about a product known as Retin-A that treats acne and acne marks and heals the scars.
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63783.0	use ice
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63784.0	First of all wash your face every morning and every night when you go to bed and even in the middle of the day if you can because your face draws alot of oil, second Go to a drugstore and buy something called KLEAR action it might be a little expensive but its like proactive and if you wash your face  2 times a day with it morning and night your face will clear up in a few days for good. 
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63784.1	Good luck!
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63785.0	Toothpaste doesn t work!! You are right!! It s for your teeth not pimples..
DW11IUHMNSNXEIV.63785.1	It takes time to let them heal but fight them head on with acne wash, toner and spot cream -before you wash do a hot compress, repeat to draw out dirt and open pores.. and if the acne needs to come to a head..
