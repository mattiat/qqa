G7HV05JXAQNUENL.7551.1	But most people like to be around people, so pick a sport. The best sport is soccer because youare running around and it is quite fun. Sports are the best motivator because its with a group and a game. Or walk with a friend. And do differnt things everytime. If you exercise 3 times a week, make each of those days a differnt thing so you won t get borred by the routine..

G7HV05JXAQNUENL.7551.3	But I might say you are unmotivated because the gym is borring. It s inside, your brain gets tired by the repetitive motions. When you are outside, your brain has to  stay alert in case a car comes and the changing scenary. Humans wern t designed to be inside exercising.
G7HV05JXAQNUENL.12693.0	You need to seriously decide whether you want to go to the gym or not 1st off .What I can tell you is this.you have to expend energy to gain energy..
G7HV05JXAQNUENL.12693.1	If you do nothing then you will feel like doing nothing,I know it seems odd as you are feeling lazy or tired and the last thing you might want to do is be active,but trust me if you get active you will have more energy..
G7HV05JXAQNUENL.12693.2	I love going to the gym in fact I get a lil pouty when the gym is closed on Sundays lol I just feel better when I work out..
G7HV05JXAQNUENL.12693.3	Get out there and do it and each day you will feel more like doing it.but you have to take the 1st step :)
