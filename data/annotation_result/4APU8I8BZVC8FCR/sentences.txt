4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.1	You can trace the path of the development step by step, there are no secrets, humans worked hard and put a lot of thought into getting into space.
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.2	 We all stand on the backs of giants This means that a few brilliant people will come along and think up things that no one else has, and the rest of us, while we didn t have the ability to think it up, we had the ability to quickly learn the concept.
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.3	 You see this with writing.
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.4	 Writing in some form or another is thought to have been around for at least 7000 years, possibly longer, yet there are cultures in which it didn t exist until recently, such as the Navajo culture.
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.5	 It wasn t that reading and writing were beyond them, someone just had to introduce them to the idea.
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.6	 They were well familiar with symbolism..The
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.7	The same is true of Newton s kinematics equations, algebra, and just about anything else..
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31245.8	Humans have a very impressive brain, don t under estimate it.
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.31246.0	It was the Wizard of Oz. Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain..

The industrial revolution in the late 18th century did not really get going until we learned how to make steel in a big way. So, it s been an evolution in metals for which we owe a lot of things including cars, airplanes, trains and modern ships..
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.83257.1	The thing is that once you had steel, for instance, you could build the machines that build the machines.  Steel is produced with ingredients that are not obvious and is not obtained simply my heating up ore and pouring off the molten metal.  SO, once you have the secret, everything takes off..
4APU8I8BZVC8FCR.83257.2	Then once you had airplanes c1903, it is not a hard stretch to rockets, especially if you have a couple of world wars to get scientists motivated.  The fact is that you couldn t get to the moon with stone rockets, could you?
