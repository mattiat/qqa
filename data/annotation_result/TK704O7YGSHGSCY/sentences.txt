TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.0	I have used just about everything!! A lot of it depends on your skin type-things that work for some don t work for others and some things can actually make your zits worse, especially if you have sensitive skin.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.1	 Plus, treaments vary with the condition of the zit.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.2	 Big, hard lumpy ones vs little white heads, ones with heads vs one s w/out heads, poppable vs non-poppable, pussy vs dried out one s, lots of little zits -or a few big ones etc.. but here are some common helpers..I h
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.3	I have sensitive skin, but it is also combination skin, in that it is dry in some spots and oily in others. I usually just get random big zits here and there-usually on my chin..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.4	I have tried toothpaste- the only kind that works is the plain white paste NON- whitening-the whitening agents will actually make your zit worse-which is why if you brush with that stuff keep it off your chin or it could cause breakouts. A plain mud mask-apply a big glob directly to the zit and let it dry..it will pull out the pus and dry it out. Wash it off and repeat every couple of hours. You can also try a mud mask w/ tea tree, kills bacteria and very soothing-plus help the dry out process..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.5	Homemade=baking sodaWhatever treatment you use and depending on the zit type (big under ground, head or no head etc..)Sometimes it helps to poke a hole in the zit with a pin so the mask can penetrate inside the pore to dry it from the inside out-it make dry out and go away quicker..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.6	Be careful-heat the pin w/ a match then dip in alcohol-poke gently-squeeze with fingers wrapped in toilet paper to help keep nails from digging into skin to prevent scarring..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.7	For a bigger zit that is under ground and probably will not make a head so that it can burst and then heal and go away-ice it right away as often as possible! It should go away quikly. If one is forming a head, but not fast enought and your anxious to pop it and treat it-apply a cotton ball dipped in hot water directly to the zit-or put your head over a bowl of hot water to steam it..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.8	If the zit is infected-red, hot and throbby-put some hydrogen peroxide on it and then glob it with antibiotic ointment. Keep ointment away from you eyes as it can cause eye pain that mimics and eye infection..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.9	My co-worker swears by rubbing alcohol directly on the zit-I haven t tried it, but she says it dries it out very quickly..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.10	I used to glob noxema (cheap) and/or clearasil white cream facial wash straight on the zit, it does the same type of extraction/drying out combo..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.11	If none of these help-get proactive (it s expensive but a little goes a long way&worth it)-I swear by it.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.12	 I use the moisterizer after the wash and toner all over and then the best part- use it when I get a zit by covering the zit with a glob of it and letting it sit for the night (when I m at home).
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.13	 It pulls out the pus and dries the zit out, which then scabs up and flakes off completely within days (if you don t mess with it too much).
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.32436.14	Good luck-Zits are the worst!!!
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.0	It depends on the cause of acne, for a lot of girls/women acne can be a result of hormonal imbalance in which case taking Evening Primrose Oil on a daily basis would help a lot, also using black cohosh or vitex would probably help a little if it is hormonal as well.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.1	 Some acne issues can also simply be a result of diet, so it may be an idea to talk to a doctor to get blood tests done, better still would be a doctor who practices alternative as well as conventional medicine as they would be more likely to address your body as a whole rather than the individual area of skin as well as be more open to natural remedies.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.2	 An increase in zinc, vitamin C and vitamin E should help you, I would also suggest stepping up your iron intake, reducing your salt intake and perhaps taking flax seed.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.3	 The skin is a major exit point for toxins from your body, it may be a good idea not only to look at your diet but also look into detoxing.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.4	 Oil Cleansing Method [OCM]is something I use myself with great success and I know a lot of other people use it not just for spots but all round skin health so I recommend it to everyone ??? in my caseI primarily started using it to deal with oily skin and flaky skin, the fact it cleared up my spots and helped to heal up old acne scars was just a benefit..Thi
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.5	This works on the principle I went into above, you strip your skin of the oils then your body will overcompensate, this method is literally using oil to cleanse your skin..
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.6	Most people start out with 50 % Extra Virgin Olive Oil [EVOO]and 50% Castor Oil [CO], the EVOO is moisturising and the CO is cleansing ??? if you have really oily skin you may want to start with a slightly different mix say 25:75 EVOO:CO because that means you are getting more of the cleansing oil.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.7	 Another VERY good oil to use is Jo-joba oil because it is very similar to the natural oils already on your face ??? I recommend you try the EVOO:CO mix and if you find your skin reacts well to that (or if it reacts badly ??? which I doubt it will) then switch over to 100% Jo-joba oil, this is what I have been using for the past five months..Bas
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.8	Basically what you do is whenever you need to clean your face you take the oil and put it onto your face, you then take a face cloth that has been in very hot water, wring it out and then put it on your face for a minute, and you then wipe off the oil.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.9	 Basically the oil acts as a cleanser to take all the filth from your skin, and the hot face cloth helps open up your pores.
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.10	 You then use toner to help close up the pores again and remove any excess oil you may have missed and moisturiser ??? these are not necessary, but it is very good to use good natural toners and moisturisers no matter what you do with your face to wash it..Wit
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.11	With OCM you have the benefit of something that gives you really nice moisturised healthy skin as well as deals with most skin problems, but it is also very cheap given as most oils can be bought just from your supermarket, it is natural so healthier for you, not tested on animals so it is ethical, but also it is totally
TK704O7YGSHGSCY.50709.12	customisable ??? so say if your skin starts to get dry you just change to a better oil or change the basic mix to include the more moisturising oil (EVOO), you can customise it daily, you can also add essential oils such as lavender or tea tree oil that can help deal with preventing spots and healing your skin..
