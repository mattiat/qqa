The oven, chair, clock, computer, house, phone, and even the animals seems to serve each others purpose in the balance of life.  But what about us, and our purpose?  Within the span of a 70-80 year old life, at some point, there is a question asked about self purpose.  For some that question looms for their whole life.  For others, this craving is satisfied..
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.1	Is this feeling legitimate?  If I were to say ???No??? then that would imply a lack of hope.  If you have hope for eternal truth then the desire to search it out will never leave.  So instead of the pain in angst, consider the hope of truth and the resolution between yourself and that truth..
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.2	Now your last question is actually a VERY good one.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.3	  Because it implies that you recognize the responsibility of knowing the truth.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.4	  Once you have found the truth you must live with your relationship to that truth.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.5	  If your life is not in harmony with the truth then YOU must be the one to change, as the truth will not.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.6	  So perhaps the first step in the journey is, understanding that you must be willing to change.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.7	  Once the pain of change has occurred however, the world is discovered again, as if you are looking through a new window of beliefs.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27528.8	  The experience is not terrifying but liberating.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.0	Certainly there exists a full spectrum of responses to the curiosty of life s meaning.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.1	 On one end of that spectrum could be Existential, ie life has no meaning.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.2	 It simply is because you perceive it to be;
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.3	 If there is a meaning to life, it too, existentially, must exist only because you percieve it.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.4	 To ponder the order of existence or your place in it is simply recreational.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.5	 Just like solving sudokus, some people enjoy the pondering more than others.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.6	 (This does not include those whose intellect simply precludes philosophical ponderings.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.7	) While notfamiliar with the term Existential Angst, I presume it is both legitamate and obsessive in your case.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.8	 Legitimate because it is unavoidable, and obsessive because you percieve it to be..I w
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.27529.9	I would not say get out of it ! Explore the curiosity of life s mission or lack thereof.. fearlessly. Accept that you can never know, and pursue the best course.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.0	Existential angst is the anxiety of the possibly meaninglessness of existence.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.1	  Is it legitimate or self-obsessive?
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.2	  I would have to say that depends on the degree to which it is taken.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.3	  Some questioning of meaning and tradition is a good thing, but a person who suffers because the meaning of life is not spelled out in the sky in large golden letters is taking it too far.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.4	  If one uses it as a legitimate platformto question the assumptions and existence of their life, I would take it as a positive thing.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.5	  If instead of using their existential angst to rebuild a stronger self with a more defensible outlook on life, they wallow in self-pity and depression, they are probably approaching the issue from the wrong angle.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.6	  Whether somebody experiences existential angst or not, and the degree to which they experience it depends largely on the experiences they have encountered in life.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.7	  I believe that somebody who lives comfortably, never hears any challenges to their worldview, nevers hears any contrary opinions, and never has any experience causing them to question their assumptions would not be too likely to have existential angst.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.8	  Unfortunately (or fortunately if you look at it a different way) this is very rare.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.9	  Almost everybody at some point in their life encounters a problem which their personal philosophy has trouble resolving.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.10	  I think that people not feeling existential angst are probably those on opposite ends of the spectrum:  they have either never been exposed to the real world and have never wondered about their prupose, or they have thought about the issue extensively and resolved it to their satisfaction.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.11	  How to get out of existential angst?
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.12	  There are a lot of answers.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.13	  I think Heidegger would say to become an authentic self - do that which is true your self.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.14	  Nietzsche would say to live your life aesthetically, not worrying about tradition, but instead seeing your life as an artwork.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.15	  Buddhism says to recognize that the idea of a self separated from the world and others is a dangerous illusion, an illusion which causes existential angst.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.16	  Me personally, not that i have resolved the meaning of my own existence, I would say to find a community which shares your values and interests because humans get personal value from social interaction and meaning from tradition.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.17	  Also to recognize that having a meaning prescribed to you (as most people seem to want) is actually a worse option than choosing your own meaning.
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.18	  Every moment that you spend worrying about your existence is one less moment to be enjoying that existence, so act..UPD
RPN44C7TZO8T3O8.79434.19	UPDATE: i was a little sloppy with my heidegger answer, he would say to be authentic, which to him means being in the world and caring for the world.
