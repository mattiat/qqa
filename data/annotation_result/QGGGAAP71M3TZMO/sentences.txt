QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.18011.1	Eat healthy.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.59462.0	im 13, 5 11 and i weigh 192 pounds.one word to help you out. conditioning. 
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.59462.1	I play right tackle for the offensive line in indiana. i weighed 170 pds and was 5 7. in under a year, i skyrocketed. football is the answer.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.0	Hi guy...you are not the first 13 year old that I ve talked to about similar problems..
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.1	Please, please just slow down a little.  Most 13 year old boys are short (5 2) and you are not..Most have a lot of baby fat still there (you do not).However, you DO have something in common:  Lack of testosterone!  That won t kick in until you are about 16.  With the testosterone, your muscles will begin to enlarge and your height will shoot up..
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.2	At your age I would suggest you jog, play hard sports and watch what you eat;;;;;that is, make sure your fast food eating is limited greatly .   It is chocked full of the fats that your body does not need and you will live to regret it.  Limit pastas, and other carbs (if it is white or a bread product of any color, it is a carb) including pizzas which not only is loaded with fats, but the bigger the crust, the worse the carbs..
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.3	Eat lots and lots of veggies in any shape and form.  Eat lots and lots of fish and chicken (skinless of course..that lets out KFC, eh?)  Under the skin is lots and lots of fat..
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.4	You don t want to gainweight by eating fats.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.5	  Fat does not build muscle, it adds fat..ugh!
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.6	  You don t need equipment, believe me.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.7	  Tell you what, have you ever held a can of veggies in your hands with your arms straight out at your sides?
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.8	   Have you ever grabbed a 10# sack of potatoes with 2 hands, put them over your head and lowered them behind your head and back up?
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.9	  Or lowered them to your waist and lifted them back up???  You are in for a treat!!!!All this aside, at 13, you just need to play hard, jog 5 miles, do a bookoo number of pushups for the pecs, and sit ups for the stomach, leg raises for the belly and you can sweat a lot doing this stuff, then wait for your body to grow up a little..You
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62319.10	You ll be just fine, believe me...I am an RN (registered nurse)ps  Please don t tie ropes and do that dumb thing that juvenile suggested above.  You are much smarter than that, hopefully.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62320.0	You can t gain height, but as a boy, you have quite a few years till you stop growing, so be patient.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.0	In regard about how to be taller, you might not want to start working out so soon..
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.1	This is not true for everybody because every person s body is different, but it is known sometimesit is not a good idea for a young teenager to start lifting weights.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.2	 The reason is because when you build so much muscle, it inhibits your bone growth.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.3	 But you can still do some exercises to look buff so you can get chicks.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.4	 I didn t have proper equipment when I was young, but was able to build and tone my muscles doing various things.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.5	 Push ups and sits ups are a start.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.6	 Find anything you can in your house.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.7	 My mom used to have a microphone stand.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.8	 I used to unscrew and screw it on to the stand really fast to build up my forearm muscle.
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.9	 It s not WHAT you use to work out, but HOW you work out..Als
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.10	Also, you can work out different parts of your chest and arms depending on how far part you put your hands when you do push ups. Spread out your arms wide if you want to work out more on your pecs. Keep your arms in closer to your body if you want to work out tripceps and biceps. You will see the difference because you will feel the burn in different parts of your arms and chest. You do not need fancy equipment or even free weights..
QGGGAAP71M3TZMO.62321.11	Finally, in regards to being taller, make sure you eat right and exercise. Eating protein (meat, eggs, nuts) will help a lot while you are working out. But don t forget about fruits and vegetables too.
