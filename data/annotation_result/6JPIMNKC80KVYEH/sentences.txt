6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.0	Kris L gave you an excellent answer..
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.1	Back to your original questions. Did you have good medical insurance at the time the melanoma was removed? If not, this was one reason the reason the sentinel node biopsy probably was not done. Another reason would be that the node biopsy would be disfiguring and that never makes for a happy young person..
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.2	While the survival statistics for a large group of people may be no different, you are not a large group of people - just one person.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.3	 The only percentage that is important to you is the single percent made up by your being.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.4	 Do not get fixated on prognosis statistics.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.5	 The results from a sentinel node biopsy would have been handy for your Dr s info because if a node was affected you could have begun high dose interferon or began looking into experimental therapies.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.6	 As it is your first sign of a recurrence will either be another melanoma or suddenly getting very ill.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.7	 Being in this position truly sucks but then again many aspects of having cancer truly suck.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.8	 At this point in time about the best thing you can do is follow Kris s advice and live your life to the fullest.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.9	 This does not mean partying but living your life with in the most meaningful and satisfying manner - your ideal life.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.10	 It is too late to worry about the what ifs of whether you should have had the sentinel node biopsy or what might happen a year down the road.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.11	 Instead see your oncologist and dermatologist every three months for regular check ups and then the rest of the time get on with your life and live your life to the max.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44754.12	  good luck and all the best
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44768.0	That s sad.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44768.1	Sorry to hear that.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44768.2	Your doctor should check you periodically and retest you again.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.44768.3	You have to ask your doctor.
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.0	I m sorry you had melanoma . it s a TERRIBLE disease.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.1	I know because I ve had malignant melanoma (much worse than just melanoma) twice . both primary cancers.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.2	I look like someone tried to burn my head off from behind from the scarring, and that scar goes from armpit to armpit because they took the lymph nodes on both sides and amputated six muscles at the back of my neck.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.3	Doctors should do tests . both on the live patient and on the excised cancer to tell if the person is terminal . but they don t ALWAYS know.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.4	I was told I was terminal with only three months to live, after my first surgery on my neck . 
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.5	I was only 21 years old at the time.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.6	I looked at that doctor and told him that I would dance on his grave and that he would be very old when he died.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.7	When I had the second cancer 19 years later, the doctor asked ME how long I wanted to live . he knew I was the oldest living patient to have what was by that time the routine surgery . 
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.8	I told him I planned to live to be at least 150, and then I told him he d have to do the surgery in the outpatient clinic, and not put me into the hospital for a month or more . which he did.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.9	Your level III cancer was BAD, but the surgery should have removed all of it.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.10	You ll need to see a doctor at least once every six months for the next five years or longer . but YOU CAN LIVE A LONG LIFE.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.11	Don t give in and think that the cancer is going to kill you . fantasize the cancer cells in your body as being weak and sickly, and the immune system cells as being HUGE SOLDIERS who can wipe them out.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.12	I dressed my immune soldiers like Roman Guards from Jesus s time, but you can dress yours the way you want to . but do this fantasy at least four times every day . it takes less than five minutes, but those five minutes are IMPORTANT to you in many different ways.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.13	This kind of fantasy is a type of meditation and time has showed that this meditation/fantasy can make a HUGE DIFFERENCE in your survivability rate. 
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.14	Second, don t eat the healthy food that everyone says is best . learn to listen to your body and eat what it wants . which may be chocolate, or fried oysters, broccoli, cherries, or fresh applesauce.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.15	When you have cancer, your body needs different things . vitamins, minerals, antioxidants . and the food you ll crave will have those things in the amounts you ll need.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.16	I ve been cancer free for over 19 years since the second cancer, and I STILL listen to my body and eat ONLY WHAT SOUNDS GOOD, and not what others tell me is good for me.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.17	I used to LOVE broccoli best, now I can t even bear to see it on my plate .but my husband loves it, so we buy broccoli and cauliflower and he separates the two onto our plates.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.18	Third . 
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.19	PAMPER YOURSELF.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.20	Tell the people who live with you that you NEED THIS to be able to survive, just as you need the meditation and the cravings answered instead of normal nutrition .  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.21	Take a long hot bath, get books you like to read and read them daily . go for long walks in the woods, or sit by the stream and watch the water go by.  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.22	This is to help your body to KNOW EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY . if you go on a strict cancer fighting diet and have lots to do every day with no time for YOURSELF, you ll get sicker . so grab a chocolate bar or a can of smoked oysters, and grab a good book and go sit out in the shade in a comfy chair . and tell everyone that you are fighting your cancer in a way that will help you LIVE to a ripe old age . say 220 years?  
6JPIMNKC80KVYEH.87219.23	I ve had to up mine . there s still so much to learn and do, and I m just a little girl yet . at 56!
