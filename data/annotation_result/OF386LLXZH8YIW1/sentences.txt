OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.0	Because we don t need it.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.1	 Marijuana is not practical in any degree.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.2	 It has a list of abusive problems a mile long.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.3	 Granted it isn t as bad as alcohol in any respect.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.4	 For example driving while impared on marijuana won t impare your abilities as bad as alcohol, but marijuana users seem to feel the need to specifically test how dangerous it is to drive while smoking as much as possible.

OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.7	Then there is the addiction problem.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.8	 Yes, marijuana isn t as addictive as alcohol or heroin.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.9	 However about 1 in 10 people do become dependant on this.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.10	 Far less than other drugs, yes, but still noticable.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.11	 Then there is the lung problem.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.12	 No marijuana won t cause cancer.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.13	 It has been proven to cause just about every other lung problem.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.14	 Medical marijuana.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.15	 There are good and bad things here.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.16	 Smoking marijuana is worthless.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.17	 The whole pain relieving effect is too short lived to be avantagous.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.18	 It needs to be eaten or made into a vapor to be effective.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.19	 You might notice that there is no shinning endorsements above.
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29830.20	 Yes, it isn t as bad as alcohol.

OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29831.1	Marijuana is too useful. 
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29831.2	It s too easy to grow and its too good. 
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29831.3	I smoke marijuana everyday and i go to school full-time and work full-time. 
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29831.4	I love marijuana and i will never quit smoking. 
OF386LLXZH8YIW1.29831.5	I don t care about our stupid laws. when i smoke weed it only affects me..nobody else. i don t drive when i m high and I m always alone so i can t possibly harm another person. therefore, i will continue to break this law until the day i die. breaking laws that might harm another person is an entirely different story. what only affects you is your own business. i say break the law with me smoke up and maybe one day this reefer madness culture will finally come to an end.
