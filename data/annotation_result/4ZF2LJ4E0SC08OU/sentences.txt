4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.0	All cancer deserves equal funding.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.1	 It is an absolute horror no matter what age, stage or grade or type of cancer you have.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.2	 A horror.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.3	 I cannot in good conscience try to pick out one cancer that should receive more attention and more funding than another, including breast cancer.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.4	 I am glad that they have the support and organization to lead the fight against their cancer.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.5	 On the other hand, I have a child with a rare cancer.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.6	 There is always a sinking feeling in my gut because children and young people with his disease are dying.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.7	 Pretty much all of them . . and it is a rotten, rotten cancer that robs these young people of life.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.8	 Their bellies fill up with multiple huge tumors that become so heavy they can no longer stand up.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.9	 I cannot even convey how misearable this disease is.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.10	 It is so difficult when the little ones, the five to ten year old children have this cancer.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.11	 I know that there are other diseases out there that deserve funding and research, but my heart aches for the young people suffering from abdominal sarcoma.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.12	 There are no pink ribbons for them.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.13	 There are no advocates for them.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.14	 They are invisible in our society.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.15	 They die slowly and painfully and out of the way so that no one notices.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.16	 And, it s nobody s fault..But
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.17	But, back to the question, the reason for the disparity is simply . . large numbers of people, survivors,  and a good solid organization dedicated to education and advocating for funds to stop breast cancer.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.18	 Rare cancers do not have the organization because they don t have the numbers of people needed for a campaign and truthfully, few survivors are left to advocate for their disease.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.19	 And, although the medical community is intrigued by this rare cancer, currently funding is limited for cancers that could save so few people, and there is no active research taking place.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.20	 People with rare cancer at the moment . . are expendable.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.21	 They are the part of the statistics rattled off casually..But
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.22	But what can you do? There is little we can do about it. So, we just do the best that we can and always stay focused and hopeful. And, yeah, we support research for all cancer..
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37681.23	Maybe someday I ll have the energy to do more. But, for now, I do what I can by doing research and have created a patient database searching for treatments that may benefit them all.
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.0	I dont know. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.1	But dont I think a difference in publicity in this case means a difference in research funds. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.2	Not all the money in research comes from such campains. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.3	If you look at the actual funds, even for academic research, most of it (the biggest amounts, which are actually an investment) comes from pharmas. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.4	If there are a lot of people suffering from it, pharmas will definetely invest. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.5	The more people, the more money they get. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.6	Remember, those companies are in stock markets, in which retirement funds are invested. 
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37682.7	You wouldn t like them to make bad investments, would you ?
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37683.0	While all cancer is obviously a terrible thing, most people don t realize how ordinary it is: about 1 in four of us will develop some form of cancer in our lifetime.  Prostate cancer generally strikes older men, and though sometimes very serious, the men who have it often die of something else age-related first.  Breast cancer strikes women of all ages..
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37683.1	Breast cancer has also become one of the more manageable cancers over the last few years.  I know this sounds like a cold, hard choice, but who would you rather save, if you had to choose; a 25-year-old mother of two babies, or a 74-year-old grandfather who has lived a rich, full life??
4ZF2LJ4E0SC08OU.37683.2	Lung cancer from tobacco products is a lifestyle choice! *(Yes, I know that not all lung cancer is a consequence of tobacco use, but an awful lot of it is.)
