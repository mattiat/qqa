DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.0	As a professional painter and part time studio art college instructor, I find that the arts are incredibly important to opening the mind to all kinds of subjects, not just art.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.1	We don t value intuitive knowledge in our culture.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.2	It is this intuitive intelligence that helps scientists, inventors, engineers, researchers, theorists, philosophers, mathmeticians, artists and doctors make very important decisions and finds in their fields.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.3	In this way, art and the processes that are learned in all art forms touch all professions.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.4	Art in all forms helps open us up to those intuitive processes.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.5	I think that the arts are some of the most important aspects of education.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.6	To cure this deficiency in our education system we simply need to offer more classes, opportunities for students to participate in the arts, and allow students to bring these arts out into the community.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.7	But we can t do this when schools are constantly cutting funding to the arts.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.8	I believe that the arts should be more integrated into an overall liberal arts curriculum  from Kindergarten thru college.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.9	To do this we need a commitment from school districts, politicians, parents and educators to do this.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.10	We need an allocation of some of the tax dollars that go to education to fund art education.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.11	I also think a public relations campaign on a national level that spells out the benefits of arts in our education system would help get the public behind it.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.12	It would have to be on the level of how it is not only beneficial in and of itself, but how art touches all of our lives.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.13	How it is important not only for personal expression but for human communication.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.14	And, how learning and practicing an art form is great for learning other subjects and making break throughs in those professions.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.1032.15	Afterall, Einstein played the violin beautifully.
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.0	As budgets become squeezed, it appears that money for non necessities in modern education need to be paid for by the student wishing to study such things.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.1	This includes sports and other non educational activities beyond science, reading, writing and math.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.2	Since every student needs to be proficient in these things for a basic education, then other subjects and activities may very well be considered extracurricular studies.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.3	The other solution may be to augment our schools with others that specialize in things like the arts.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.4	That way resources could be pooled for the benefit of each group. 
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.5	The arts and humanities are a valuable contribution to the quality of our lives.  
DF7HCQW0BPGMVKI.42741.6	Until we rein in our desire for things like sports, which get chased by big money and big business by way of the media, the arts will always be underfunded and take a back seat.
