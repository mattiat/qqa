DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.0	ok, well i am a respiratory therapist, so lets see if i can help you.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.1	 there are two ways to give the treatment, either by wearing a mask, or doing a blow by method, which i will explain.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.2	 the nebulizer container should look like a little cup.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.3	 break off the top of your medicine vial (im assuming that u are giving albulterol) and squeeze it into the cup.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.4	 attatch the plastic t piece looking thing.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.5	 now attatch the mask to that or try the blow by method.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.6	 add the tubing to one end of the t piece and a piece of tape to the other end.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.7	 this is to prevent it from coming back out.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.8	 hook up the air tubing and turn on you neb machine.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.9	 with the blow by he doesnt have to have any thing touching his face, just a mist blowing in front of it to get him use to the idea.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.10	 make is seem fun, sing songs play games, watch tv.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.11	 eventually work up to the mask, he gets more of the medication that way.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.12	 but not untill he is ready for it.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.13	 if all else fails give it to him screaming, he will actually get more medication that way due to deeper breaths.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.14	 dont worry about getting anything from a simple case of asthma! no 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.15	no contagious diseases there! 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.16	Also, about the cold weather, the albuterol will open his lungs up, it is a bronchdiliator. cold weather could cause bronchspasm to occur in asthmatics. its a way of testing to see if you are asthmatic, along with many other tests. so just be smart about your activities and learn to read your sons ques about his breathing. 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.17	The actual maching will last until it poops out, but check and change the filter on it    frequently. also clean your equipment daily with a water and vinegar solution. you dont want to be inhaling germs! 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.18	If he isnt a light sleeper, give the treatment by blow by at night to him if you feel he needes it. 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.19	Oh yeah, try to keep the medicing cup upright so that it works better at aersolizing the medication. ask your doctor about using a peak flow on your son before and after treatments. it will give you a good sense as to whether the treatments are helping or not. if you have any questions ask your doctor or call the 800 number that is one the nebulizer box or information packet. they will be glad to help you. 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.4348.20	I know this was a long explanation, but i truely hope that it helps you and your son have a better relationship with what may be a lifetime companion. good luck
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.0	Several things to add here..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.1	First and foremost, whoever supplied you with the equipment should have provided instruction and should be available at least by telephone to answer your questions on how to use it.  That s their job.  You have every right to expect it..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.2	Ask your doctor whether you are to give the treatments on a regular basis or only as needed - unless he has a history of frequent problems, it is most likely as needed.  No sense picking more fights than necessary..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.3	At 5 years he should be able to use a mouthpiece.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.4	  Imagine if you were five, having problems breathing, and someone wanted to cover your face with a smelly plastic mask.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.5	  Also, a treatment with the mouthpiece can deliver more than twice as much of the medication to the lungs.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.6	  It may take some coaching to get him to breathe through his mouth and not his nose.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.7	  Try gently pinching off his nose for one breath at a time until he gets the hang of it, even better have him hold his own nose.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.8	  Tell him it s so he won t smell the medicine.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.9	  You can monitor how well he is doing - when he inhales the mist should stop blowing out the other end.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.10	  If not, he is inhaling through his nose and not getting any medication..Don
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.11	Don t fight him.  A crying child spends nearly all the time breathing out (screaming) and very little of the time inhaling.  He only gets the medicine while he is inhaling..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.12	Ask about changing to a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) with a holding chamber.  Bit much to explain here but much simpler, it onlyinvolves half a dozen breaths or so, and can used anywhere - no compressor needed..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.13	Don t sweat the gloves.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.14	  IF going out in the cold triggers an attack, a scarf wrapped around the lower face would be good.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.15	  Less noticeable than a mask, and still traps as much warm air and moisture.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.16	  If there is no persistent problem, leave it be.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.17	  Being a five year old is hard enough without being the kid who had to wear a mask to play outside<grin>How long to keep the nebulizer?
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.18	  Ask the doc.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.19	  If he continues to need nebulizer treatments and cannot be converted to an MDI, or has attacks during which he cannot use an MDI, buy it (sounds as if you are renting).
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.20	  But in my experience probably half or more children who get treatments during one illness don t have a continuing problem, quite a few of the others get by just fine with inhalers, and you can get it again if you need it.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.21	  If you have insurance, get their input.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.22	  Some insurance companies are very quick to just buy a compressor since the monthly rental is sometimes as much as half the purchase price..Tre
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.62789.23	Treatments while sleeping.  Again, ask the doc since giving it during sleep comes down to whether you really need to give treatments on a schedule, like every 4 hours, as opposed to every 4 hours as needed.  Blow-by treatments deliver a very little medication to the lungs, anyway.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.0	Mommy 820is exactly right on how to give the treatment. One tip might be for you to show him how it works, of course don t put the meds in it, and breathe it yourself. Try a relaxed atmosphere, in front of a distraction like the tv..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.1	Tell him about how it is superhero medication, get him a cape to wear while doing the tx[doesn t have to cost anything, just use something around the house, or go spend money at toys are us if you have it.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.2	 You could do a treatment on yourself, stand up, flex your muscles, give a superhero yell, and put on the cape.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.3	 Heck, I d take the treatment if you played a cool game with me.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.4	 And there is always the bribe, we all get chocolate cake if we do the treatment..He 
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.5	He would get some good out of it while asleep, but better to be awake and taking deep breaths. And it might scare him if he wakes up and the mask is on him..
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.6	With proper care the machine should last awhile.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.7	 The idea behind the nebs is to open up the passages so he can tolerate the cold weather.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.8	 My Mom always wrapped a scarf around my mouth, one knitted loosely, so I could breathe warmer air.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.9	 I still do that.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.10	 If you have to limit his exposure to the cold air, then, you have to.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.11	 Just wash your hands really good before you clean the machine, if you want to wear gloves while cleaning it, do so, it can t hurt.
DO04QGGOLPGYTO8.70199.12	 You do not want to put germs into a warm moist machine and blow them at the kid.
