OMG772JPRSUC7JB.22368.0	Get some prep. guides - Barron s or Kaplan..
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.22368.1	Read their hints for each section..
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.22368.2	Do a lot of sample questions, in same timeframe as actual exam..
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.22368.3	I am not sure if it makes sence to learn vocabulary lists..
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.22368.4	I believe there s an essay question now. The books should have sample topics - write a few essays on them, pay some GRE prep teacher to grade them and give suggestions.
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.0	The newest revisions to the GRE puts the maximum score at 1600, there is no longer an analytical section - the essay question that replaced it doesn t factor into your goal of 1500 - it is scored seperately, so you would have to be near perfect in both quantitative and verbal, you would probably have to get at least in the 98th percentile for Verbal and the 80th percentile for math. 
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.1	I studied for 11 months, and got a 1300 - I did get in the 94th percentile for verbal, but mathematics is my weak point - always has been. 
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.2	So unless you don t have any weak points in math or verbal, you will not likely get near a 1500, especially in just 30 days. 
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.3	One trick to up your verbal score is to memorize about 500 vocabulary words, that should up your verbal by at least 100 or more points - at least 40% of the questions are on vocabulary. 
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.4	Use flashcards. 
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.5	As for math, the bulk of it is algebra and geometry.  
OMG772JPRSUC7JB.73716.6	Good luck.
