LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6519.11	This country anyway in the US, there is no definiation of NORMAL.
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.0	Normal?  What s normal?  No, really, in all of my life I have never found what is meant by normal..
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.1	Each of us has some time on this earth.
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.2	  We are to become the best we can be, whether that means education, job, family, or just interacting with others in a helpful or inspiring way.
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.3	  Alone?
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.4	  What do you mean by alone?
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.5	  In this age of the internet, are we really ever alone anymore.

LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.7	  There are scads of support groups out there just on Yahoo Groups alone.
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.8	  I use to think the way you do, a very long time ago.
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.9	  I finally decided that it was not everyone else s fault that I was alone and stuck in such a negative rut.
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.10	  It was my responsibility to get myself out of that rut and become the person I felt I truly was on the inside but had failed so far to show anyone on the outside..I m
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.11	I made some changes to the way I thought and approached life.  Here are the steps I took to finding self-fullfillment and enlightenment.1.  Be Grateful.2.  Forgive yourself.3.  Be kind.4.  Practice the Golden Rule.5.  Give of yourself to others.6.  Be a good friend.7.  Learn to really listen.8.  Make positive goals and time frames to meet them.9.  Approach life with the wonder of a child.10.  Have fun!!
LXAPWPR4DFEG7N4.6520.12	I did not make these changes overnight.  It took about 5 years to turn things around.  And I am not saying that my life is perfect, no, there are many things in my life that are very difficult.  But I approach each problem as a wonderful challenge and an opportunity to learn and grow from it as I solve it.  That ultimately is what life is all about you know..
