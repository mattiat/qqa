DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.0	Why do we cry at tragic dramas? Why do we laugh at comedies??
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.1	When you watch a movie, you become wrapped up in the emotional world on the screen.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.2	 You live vicariously through the characters.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.3	 If it s a good movie, if the director, cinematographer, sound people&actors have done their job then they can affect how you feel.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.4	 Horror movies use darkness, eerie music, sound effects, special effects&acting to build your suspense&then scare you with sudden movements, loud noises, a climax in the music etc.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.5	 If it s not done well then you probably won t be scared, you may even laugh.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.6	 Movies are magical because they draw us into another world where we suspend disbelief for those 2 hours.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.7	 We forget our own lives&become absorbed in the world on the screen&therefore react as though we were one of the characters, experiencing vicariously through them..A l
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39980.8	A lot of people (myself included!) like thrillers because they allow us to experience things that we never would in our own lives&from the safety of our own couches! It s a distraction from our real lives (which may have other real stresses). It s fun. Like a rollercoaster ride! An adrenaline rush. A relatively safe one!
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.39981.0	I think we hav fear in our genes,for exaample, when a shadow af the eagle is shown to a new born chick it gets afraid and tries to save itself ,likewise,every living being has the fear to save Itself which can be a danger to It,so it s in your brain to avid all dangers.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.0	Psychological research shows that fear can be acquired either through conditioning process or by  experience .
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.1	 Conditioning means that fear is a learned response   Fears that are acquired by experience are believed to be developed by observing fear in others.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.2	 Still other researchers believe that fear is a built-in symbiotic response passed down through generations.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.3	in other words, an animal response.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.4	 Some philosophers have considered fear to be a useless emotion;
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.5	 other thinkers note the usefulness of fear as a warning of potentially unpleasant situations or consequences.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.6	 Still others consider that fear is the fuel that feeds the ego..Fea
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.7	Fear is purely emotion..most times it is described as an unreasoning emotion. You KNOW that its only a movie, you KNOW that there are no such things as monsters , yet, you react..
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.8	Fear also comes with a host of physiological changes.goose bumps, rapid breathing or holding breath, pounding heart, change in body temperature, sweating, blood pumping into the large muscle groups to allow escape, ie the legs..oops..
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53451.9	I erred..I meant to say, genetic responses.not animal responses.sorry
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.0	i guess it has to do with identification with the characters, scenes, contexts etc.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.1	 they are possible and probable and they evoke our own fears because can picture ourselves in those circumstances.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.2	 of course a lot other effects are deployed to spice even simple plots eg music, visual lighting, misdirection to achieve horror effects.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.3	 look at mulholland drive or amity-ville.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.4	 watch them in mute.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.5	 no scare just strolling about.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.6	 am not sure but experience has a lot to do with it.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.7	 imagination also plays a role.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.8	 it all works as long as we can identify with  what we see and hear that already lies hidden in the castle of our skin.
DAMFNI0V8URCRPW.53452.9	 a martian will not find it scary.
