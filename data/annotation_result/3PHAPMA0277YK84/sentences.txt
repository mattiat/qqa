3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.1	My teenage son was diagnosed 22 months ago with a rare and aggressive abdominal sarcoma. He was able to undergo high dose chemotherapy for multiple tumors in the abdomen, chest wall, lympthatic system, spleen, large and small intestine, liver, lung, and right diaphragm. He also had two debulking surgery. He s done very well and has only a few nodules left on the liver..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.2	My point is that . . no one . . not even the doctor knows when someone is going to die.
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.3	 So, treat your Mom with love and respect and concentrate on how she is today . . right at this moment.
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.4	 Do not look into the future at all.
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.5	 Go be with her and enjoy her, talk, laugh, and be completely and totally honest at all times.
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.6	 Do not write her off . . on the other hand be realistic.
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.7	 You can be her source of strength . . you can smile and encourage and be her champion.
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.8	 Do not let her walk this journey alone..In 
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.9	In my sons case, no one really knew if he would survive or not. He was filled with cancer and malignant ascites. It was all pretty grim. But we maintained a positive attitude, lived each day as they came around, and just became determined to follow the path no matter which direction it took us in. We stayed by his side and felt that helping him on a journey that might include death was as important as doing everything in our power to see that he lived..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.10	Be strong, and do the best you can. In your situation that is all that anyone can do..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.11	Peace to you..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38285.12	P.S. Just to correct misinformation about Lance Armstrong. He used high dose chemotherapy BEP (Bleomycin, Etoposide and Platinol) chemotherapy, followed by three rounds of VIP chemotherapy (Ifosfamide, Etoposide and Platinol.) and two surgeries to combat his cancer:http://www.livestrong.org/site/c.jvKZLbMRIsG/b.736583/k..

3PHAPMA0277YK84.38286.2	I would just like to say keep your faith and know that if she is in pain that she will no longer hurt once she is gone. 
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38286.3	You might hurt but I m sure she, as any other mother, would not want you to hurt very bad. 
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38286.4	Talk to her about her condition, ask her questions about dying, Are you ok with dying , How would you like me to handle the situation when you are gone I know that my mother wants me to be strong for my siblings and be there to hold them together. 
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38286.5	Just talk to her and let her know you love her very much, and ask if there is anything you can do for her to make her more comfortable or just do something really nice for her that you know she s wanted her entire life!!
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.0	Honey, i am so sorry about your Mom. I know exactly what you are going through. My mom got sick in 2003 with pancreatic cancer. The drs. said there was nothing they could do except keep her pain under control..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.1	They tried. but my mom suffered so  bad..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.2	I took care of her at home until the last week of her life,she was in hospital.the pain was unbearable for her..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.3	I stayed by her side day and night. kept telling her how much i loved her..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.4	Finally one night i took her hand and told her it was ok to go that i would be ok and that i loved her so much..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.5	She was unconsious but she heard me because i lost her the next morning 5 minutes before i got to her room.it was the first time i had left her side..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.6	When i got to her room i knew she was gone..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.7	I felt the angel of death at the door..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.8	I asked the nurses and docs if i could be alone with my mom..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.9	That s when i broke down, but i knew she wasn t suffering anymore..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.10	Coping with the fact that you are losing someone isn t easy,you just have to be strong for her and take it one day at a time..
3PHAPMA0277YK84.38287.11	I think about my mom every day and i love and miss her so much, My thoughts and prayers are with you both..
