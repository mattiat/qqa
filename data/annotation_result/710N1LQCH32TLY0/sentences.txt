710N1LQCH32TLY0.469.1	Radiation can CAUSE cancer by several mechanisms.  One of the mechanisms is the production of high levels of oxidative stress .  Oxidative stress can damage DNA, causing mutations than can contribute to the carcinogenesis process..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.469.2	Radiation TREATS cancer by the same mechanism - it causes oxidative stress.  Very high levels of oxidative stress in cancer cells (and healthy cells too, which is why the therapy is so toxic) induces biochemical pathways that lead to cell suicide - a process called Apoptosis..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.469.3	In summary, radiation can cause cancer by causing oxidative stress that damages DNA and leads to mutations.  Radiation can kill cancer cells by causing higher levels of oxidative stress that cause so much damage to the cell that the cell s suicide mechanism (apoptosis) is activated and the cancer cell kills itself.  Unfortunately, this often fails as a cancer treatment because many cancer cells have mutations in their apoptotic pathways!!
710N1LQCH32TLY0.469.4	Hope this helps you understand this interesting paradox .  (P.S. You asked a very good question!  It shows you are a thinker !).
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84893.0	Radiation causes damage to the DNA of a cell causing either deformed cell replication or the loss of the cell s ability to replicate at all.  In a high enough dose it kills tissue..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84893.1	Radiation given to cancer cells kills them.  The difference is that the radiation is controlled or focused specifically on the cancer..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84893.2	What people in the medical field don t commonly tell you is that radiation is cumulative in it s effects on the body.  This means that when you have an x-ray, the damage it does to your tissues does not go away - ever.  Every time you have an x-ray, it causes more damage on top of all the other ones you ve ever had before it..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84893.3	ALWAYS ask your physician if an x-ray is absolutely necessary for a diagnosis and if there is another means of diagnosing the symptom..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84893.4	NEVER let your dentist give you a full mouth x-ray every year just because your insurance pays for it.  You only need a full mouth x-ray every 3 years or if there is a problem that can t be taken care of any other way.
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84894.0	Radiation can cause cancer on a long term basis. Tissue exposed to radiation often enough on a long term basis, increase chances of contracting cancer. A short small dose of radiation is not likely to increase your chances of cancer..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84894.1	If you already have cancer it can kill cancer cells because radiation kills fast dividing cell growth like cancer. People given radiation therapy are only exposed for a few weeks, at most month or two for therapeutic purposes..
710N1LQCH32TLY0.84894.2	The radiation given to to cancer patients is small and short in duration. The radiation that is the most likely to cause cancer is a larger amount over a long period of time. The dose alone is the poison. Radiation is an example of this.
