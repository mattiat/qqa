CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.45320.0	Hopefully it kills the cancer cells off slowly. i ahve had it myself although not on my brain. 
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.45320.1	I have beaten it 3 times now. 
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.45320.2	Good luck to your dad. 
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.45320.3	Be as supportive as you can.
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.0	So far as Radiation therapy on Brain tumors is concerned it is just like any solid tumors on any other part of body  such as cancers of the skin, head and neck, breast, prostate and cervix, etc.
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.1	   Radiation therapy can also be used to treat leukemia and lymphoma (cancers of the blood-forming cells and lymphatic system, respectively).
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.2	Radiation therapy in BRAIN TUMORS uses high-energy x-rays (ionizing radiation) to stop cancer cells from dividing.
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.3	 A rad is the scientific unit of measure of radiation energy dose.
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.4	 A patient who receives radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer will receive several thousand rads over a very short period of time (weeks or months).
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.5	 A typical x-ray contains far fewer rads..Dur
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.68829.6	During radiation therapy, x-rays deposit energy in the area being treated, damaging the genetic material of cells and making it impossible for these cells to divide. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, the normal cells are usually able to repair themselves and function properly. Like surgery, radiation therapy is a local treatment; it only affects the cells in the treated area. Radiation therapy may be used to treat localized solid tumors.-
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.87351.0	radiotherapy works by sending waves of radiation to the cancerous cells which kill them and render them ineffective in some cases. it is not 100% effective and the cells may regrow although experts say that radiotherapy minimises this and if the treatment goes well it can stop it altogether although the tumour may come back in years to follow.i hope this is helpful but more importantly i hope your dads radiotherapy goes well, and that the tumour is successfully treated. good luck.
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.87352.0	Treatment can involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Brain tumors are best treated by a team involving a neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, oncologist or neuro-oncologist, and other health care providers, such as neurologists and social workers..
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.87352.1	Early treatment often improves the chance of a good outcome. Treatment, however, depends on the size and type of tumor and the general health of the patient. The goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or the person s comfort..
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.87352.2	Surgery is necessary for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. Those that are deep inside the brain or that enter brain tissue may be debulked instead of entirely removed. Debulking is a procedure to reduce the tumor s size..
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.87352.3	Tumors can be difficult to remove completely by surgery alone, because the tumor invades surrounding brain tissue much like roots from a plant spread through soil. In cases where the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may still help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms..
CIGOYWVSIG0KY5T.87352.4	Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used for certain tumors..
