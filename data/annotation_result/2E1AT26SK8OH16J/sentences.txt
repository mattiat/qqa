2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.0	I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic&Worry that outlines various strategies..
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.1	First, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances..
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.2	Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks..
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.3	Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time..
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.4	Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.5	 First say to yourself over and over Everything is fine, it s just a panic attack.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.6	 People have them everyday.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.7	 It s uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.8	 As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly .
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.9	 breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.10	 Do this sequence 20 times in a row.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.11	 It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.12	Fifth, read the book I recommend.
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.13	 There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you..Six
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75010.14	Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic . that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? People do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75011.0	I have not had a panic attack in four years.  
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75011.1	Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75011.2	I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  
2E1AT26SK8OH16J.75011.3	I sincerely hope this helps!
