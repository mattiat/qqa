(In the end stopped taking them).You feel sick / vomit because your body is desperately trying to rid itself of what is effectively poison..
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34653.1	Easing the actual vomiting / nausea is more difficult - I lived off tea&toast for over a year! Stick to bland SMELLS - weird I know, but strong (food) smells or perfumes can trigger a response. This trigger can become more psycological if you have a strong association with a particular food / smell&the hospital.took me three years after my chemo to be able to walk past the public cafe in my local hospital without holding my breath..
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34653.2	Light mints are fairly innofensive to a sensitive system, so sipping peppermint tea serves a dual purpose - reduces nausea (medicinally) and gives your mind something else to concentrate on, ginger works equally well. Eat small, light meals to begin with - and chew everything really well (no need to say why), and drink cool (not freezing cold) water or diluted drinks. As your treatment progresses your body s response to will be less severe..
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34653.3	Seriously, all the best with your chemo. Keep a good frame of mind hang in there. I m living proof that it can work (ended chemo over 12 years ago for Extra-skeletal Ewing s Sarcoma.)
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34654.0	Check with you Oncologist.  I had a whole medicine cabinet of stuff that was just for the side effects.  Most side effects are controllable, but it may take some trial and error to find what works for you without causing more problems..
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34654.1	Best wishes!
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34655.0	Have you tried Phenergan or Zophran??
1W44CNT6MRZWKP0.34655.1	My daughter was going through chemo and radiation too, they reccomened it. but you have to get in touch with your oncologist about that any ailments may have and ask questions. they are there to help you. also try some Seagrams ginger ale(less spice than Canada Dryor Canada Dry.
