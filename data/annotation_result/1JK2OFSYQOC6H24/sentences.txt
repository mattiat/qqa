1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.0	My opinion, not a solid answer. Also, hard to write because my mind is such a mish-mash of different ideas. I ll establish some discussion, then give my answer. Skip down to the bottom if you want to go directly to my answer..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.1	I ve heard many times that anger is not a primary emotion; that anger is a sign of another more basic feeling, most often fear. This can be fear of potential injury, fear of powerlessness, fear of not getting something we want or of losing something we have. Anger can come from grief or greed or hurt feelings, all of which have fear in their roots..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.2	John Bradshaw uses the imagery that these emotions can be like having starving dogs and that instead of feeding them we lock them into the basement hoping that they will go away or die.
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.3	 They never do;
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.4	 they just become hungrier and hungrier and we have to keep reinforcing the door that they are trying to go through because they keep clawing and tearing away at it.
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.5	 Like those starving dogs, fear and anger will  never go away by being walled off.
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.6	 It is only when we accept them and give them appropriate food that they become friendly and helpful parts of the family.
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.7	 Also, like those dogs in the image, they cannot run the family but must fit in to do their part for the benefit of the whole family,not just themselves..Our
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.8	Our bodies, minds and emotional lives are the family, if you like Bradshaw s image. We can think of ourselves as a crowd inside our own head..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.9	Controlling anger, as many people say it, often means ignoring or justifying it. Of course my dogs are hungry. I ve got them locked in the basement. It explains it, but doesn t do much to help..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.10	The main problem with anger other than it just doesn t feel good, is that it seldom gets us what we want. I start with the premise that most of us want to feel good. We want a state of well-being, if not happiness. To over-simplify, feeling good feels better than feeling bad..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.11	Anger also gives energy and this is a potentially positive side of anger if we use it rightly. Anger alone will direct us to words or deeds that destroy. Anger with acceptance and thought can give us the energy to look for the best thing to think, say, or do for what we really want - inner comfort, the sense of well-being..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.12	Neither anger nor the feelings they represent come from the outside. They are inner reactions to exterior conditions which are often random and haphazard and impersonal but which we are taking personally. We re complete beings, not just parts, and we cannot be whole by trying to deny or control parts of ourselves..
1JK2OFSYQOC6H24.69078.13	In short, I would say accept the anger. Channel (not control) it toward some beneficial action EVEN IF IT IS UNRELATED to what seems to be the cause. Look for the underlying feeling that is generating the discomfort. When ready, deal with the underlying feeling the best we can whether internally or externally, but keep looking for better ways at the same time.
