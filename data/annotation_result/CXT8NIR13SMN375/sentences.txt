CXT8NIR13SMN375.9912.0	Look dear,cholesterol causes thickening of the vessel wall what is called atheromatous plaque..
CXT8NIR13SMN375.9912.1	When cholesterol deposit it causes rigidity of vessel wall,what is called atherosclerosis this causes overload on heart..
CXT8NIR13SMN375.9912.2	Amongst vessels affected are the coronaries supplying heart itself,when they are constricted this causes hypoperfusion of cardiac ms which is felt only with conditions requiring more oxygen supply e.g exercise giving rise to exertional angina..
CXT8NIR13SMN375.9912.3	Sorry I ve to go now .Bye
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.0	Please see the webpages for more details on Cholesterol.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.1	 Cholesterol is a body fat or lipid.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.2	 It is partly produced in the liver.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.3	 Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol from the liver to the tissues while High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) carries the same from the tissues to the liver where it is broken down or excreted.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.4	 Cholesterol is deposited in the inner layer of arteries particularly coronary arteries of the heart.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.5	 This will block the supply of blood to the cardiac muscles.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.6	 Thus cardiac muscles do not get sufficient oxygen.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.7	 HDL is a good cholesterol and the other 3 are bad for the health..LDL
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.8	LDL-Less than 100 mg/dL (Normal)HDL-More than 50 mg/dL (Normal)Triglycerides-Less than 150 mg/dL (Normal).
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.9	Serum cholesterol-150 to 250 mg/dL (Normal)Eat a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.10	 This kind of diet includes cottage cheese, fat-free milk, fish (not canned in oil), vegetables, poultry, egg whites, and polyunsaturated oils and margarines (corn, safflower, canola, and soybean oils).
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35504.11	 Avoid foods with excess fat in them such as meat (especially liver and fatty meat), egg yolks, whole milk, cream, butter, shortening, lard, pastries, cakes, cookies, gravy, peanut butter, chocolate, olives, potato chips, coconut, cheese (other than cottage cheese), coconut oil, palm oil, and fried foods.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35505.0	they contribute to the formation of the atherosclerotic plaqu.
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35505.1	in theis way:excess fat (LDL: low density lipoprotien) is taken up by a type of wihte blood cells (macrophages) which become foam cell which accumulate on injured endothelium (cells lining the inner surface of vessles)&form fatty streaks which progress to atherosclerotic plaque.. foam cells start secreting some medicatiors that stimulate endothelial cell prolifration and
CXT8NIR13SMN375.35505.2	platelet aggregation..the plaques give rise to symproms of angina (heart muscles deprived from blood).. these plaques might rupute and get thrombosed (finbrin forms and a mesh-like network trapes bed cells....) this give rise to myocardial infarction (heart cell death)..BOTTOM LINE: it blocks the arteries that feed the heart (coronaries) and lead to heart mucsle death..
