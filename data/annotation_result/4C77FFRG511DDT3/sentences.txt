4C77FFRG511DDT3.39590.29	YOur not going to find any answers there they are ahead of you!!!
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.0	Selfishness (or what seems like selfishness) is a by-product of depression.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.1	  So you really need to treat the depression successfully.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.2	  It sounds like the medication isn t working for you anymore, and some anti-depressant medication can cause you to have suicidal thoughts.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.3	  That s a side effect that your doctor needs to be aware of, so please tell your mom you  need to talk to the doctor this week, if possible.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.4	  Meanwhile, do not act on those thoughts.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.5	  That means, don t to through with trying to kill yourself.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.6	  The following things have been known to help depression naturally: - Exercising - Sunlight, or some type of light therapy (my daughter goes to a tanning bed 3 times a week or so, and it really does help) - Taking Omega-3 Fish Oil capsules (you can buy them at Wal-mart, but I suggest getting the coated ones).
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.7	  Take 2 a day consistently  -  do not skip and do not give up after just a couple of weeks.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.8	  It may take several weeks for it to start helping.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.9	 - B-complex - Do not take St.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.10	 John s Wort or 5-HTP supplements while you are taking anti-depressants (ask the doctor about this) - Find a hobby or an activity that you enjoy doing alone.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.11	  This will take the focus off of your paranoid feelings towards your friends.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.12	  But once in awhile, try to get your friends together to go out to the movies or something.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.13	 - Write in a journal or you can blog privately online.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.14	 - Cold showers (I think they energize and get the circulation going) - Check your library to see if they have a book on cognitive therapy for depression or anxiety.
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.15	  Learning coping skills will help you a lot in the years to come..Oka
4C77FFRG511DDT3.39591.16	Okay, that s it.  I wish you the best and I sympathize.  Don t ever give up.  Life does get better, you just have to keep hanging in there!
