College students are expected to do a lot of reading on their own so that they can digest what they learn in lectures and/or participate in smaller seminars. Most classes have 2 exams- one midterm and a final, and a project or two or a few papers depending on what type of class it is. Science and math classes at the college level are probably the most similar their AP equivalents. Similarly, you will probably have weekly homework assignments and the odd quiz here and there..
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.20809.1	In general, the main academic difference is that, since college classes are not held every day, you have a lot more to do on your own and things are more fast paced. You are less able to coast through college as you may have done in high school..
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.20809.2	I have found the biggest and most difficult change between the two to conquer was the social and environmental changes involved. You have to start worrying where your next meal will come from, you have to make a greater effort to make new friends and maintain those friendships, and you have no comfortable familiar home and family to return to each night..
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.20809.3	Don t worry about the differences too much. Basically I would say that, although the two are not at all the same, college is the logical next step up from high school in many ways and the changes will feel natural to you after a while.
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.43822.0	College is a totally new and diff world than high school. 
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.43822.1	In college.
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.43822.2	(or at least in my college)- there is no dress code- you don t have to ask for permission to leave the room- there is lecture..and whether or not you want to participate is up to you (unless you want to get a bad participation grade by not saying anything.no one forces you to answer their questions or talk)-making up work is almost unheard of.if you do it you do it..if you don t.s*cks to be you.
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.43822.3	-you can go to school at times that are convienient for you-there is much much more reading.
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.86959.0	Depends on where you go, what you take, and your teachers. 
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.86959.1	For me, I think college is better then high school, but i went to a VEEEEEERY strict high school. 
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.86959.2	No uniforms, just a few simple dress code rules, you could wear pajama pants if you wanted. 
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.86959.3	Some of my classes are only 53 minutes long. if the teacher is not there, then class is cancelled.  
5E4JR2OZEE4ULQV.86959.4	Not really alot of homework, just alot of notes and studying.
