N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.1	  Diet is a very important factor, so researching and getting educated will pay off, as far as understanding what causes elevated blood pressure.
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.2	  But this works for me, and I always get compliments from my doctor about my healthy blood pressure range (I m a 42 male, by the way).
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.3	Include more fiber in your diet, specially soluble fiber.
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.4	  Eat your oatmeal.
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.5	  I use a lot of flaxseeds in my diet.
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.6	  I grind them in a coffee grinder and mix it with almost everything.
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.7	  With the flaxseed I obtain added nutrition with Omega-3 fats.
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.8	  The soluble fiber acts in your gut as a sponge to Cholesterol, so less Cholesterol is absorbed from the diet..Tra
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.9	Transition from unhealthy fats to Healthy fats.  That is.. avoid.. Hydrogenated oils, the so called Trans fats.  I use plenty of olive oil in my diet, plus I eat nuts moderately, specially almonds and walnuts..
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.10	This one is almost a miracle for blood pressure, garlic.  Add more garlic to your diet.   And if regular garlic odor to offensive for you our your significant one to bear, there are odorless tablets that they sell at the pharmacy or health store.   I suggest taking them daily and you ll see the miracle drop in your blood pressure..
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.11	Keep active, exercise moderately at least 3 times a week..
N73UQIBEPT5HYJ1.85459.12	And please, please. don t try prescription drugs until you try some of the above.  I ve seen that most people who take them just want to keep on their unhealthy eating habits and having a pill working the miracle for them.   But in your case it seems that diet change will help you bring your levels to normal..
