5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.0	I don t mean to make light of how you feel . . however, lets put this in perspective . . for me the one with advanced cancer is my darling son, my child.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.1	 He has a rare stage IV abdominal sarcoma that metastasized throughout his body.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.2	 We didn t know if he would survive the first month after diagnosis because some of his tumors were as large as volley balls.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.3	 But all that was over two years ago.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.4	 We took everything day to day and fought the cancer by research and finding the best treatment possible.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.5	 He has undergone 9 months of high dose chemotherapy, three major abdominal and thoracic surgeries, more chemotherapy, and now a Clinical Trial..We 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.6	We still cope and deal with this life threatening illness on a daily basis because there is no guarantee with this disease..
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.7	My best advice to you is to support your friend by visiting or calling regularly.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.8	 Your friend already knows that you feel bad for him . . he knows everyone feels bad . . but that does not change the situation.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.9	 He still has cancer no matter how badly you feel.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.10	 So, the best thing to do is to treat him normally, ask him if he wants to go places or do things with you that you ve always done together.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.11	 Do not assume that just because he has cancer he can no longer go out and enjoy life.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.12	 Invite him places, treat him normally.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.13	 If he wants to talk about the cancer than listen to him, other wise . . just be his friend.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.14	 That is all your friend wants or needs from you.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.15	 Treat him as normally as possible.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.16	 He will appreciate it.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48253.17	 And, remember . . the cancer is not about you and how badly you feel . . this is about you being a good friend.
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.0	Don t think of cancer as a case of getting older Cancer strikes the young as well the older people. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.1	It is also not a death sentence . 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.2	Was it caught early? 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.3	was it caught late? 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.4	Is he seekig a second opinion? 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.5	Apparently yours is a deep friendship, for you to care this much. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.6	Some things to remember. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.7	This is still your friend, he hasn t changed. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.8	Yes, he has a disease, and things will be different. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.9	He may not be able to do things you used to do in the past. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.10	But now would be the time to explore different things.  
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.11	offer to help, but don t push yourself on him. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.12	As hard as this is for you to accept, it is even harder for him, and his family to accept. 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.13	Be yourself, if you went fishing with him, continue to go fishing, go bowling, have a bbq! 
5MWR0HX5V54D68R.48254.14	(once treatments start, it may be hard), but continue to be his friend.
