#Ah, I don t think you ve been around this board very long if that s your perception of things. Homeschoolers are the first to say it s not for everyone, they are the most supportive in parents and kids making a decision that will work well for them rather than just giving a blanket statement of homeschool, it s better and more. On the reverse side, there are PLENTY of people who post who do not consider homeschooling a viable option and are fully vocal about it..
