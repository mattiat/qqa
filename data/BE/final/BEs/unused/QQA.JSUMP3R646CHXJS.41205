#B. If you are referring to people who aren t sure about it, grumble, etc than I have found it s usually a lack of education on their part as to what homeschool really means; or a lack of the ability to think for themselves about a subject - often they themselves are a product of the ps, or teachers, or have been indoctrinated about socializaton and haven t taken the time to really consider the matter for themselves.
