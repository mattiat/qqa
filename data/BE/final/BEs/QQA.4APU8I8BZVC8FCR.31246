#There have been several references to The Fallen and the Watchers  Shape shifters and the like. The wheel was a representation of what they saw. A flying saucer or flying wheel. That is why the so called serpent tempted man with knowledge to teach about sciences and the laws of nature and self It would seem that there were some arguments between  these people as to how to teach us and still respect them. I read this somewhere and just remembered it. Maybe it was a comic book.?
