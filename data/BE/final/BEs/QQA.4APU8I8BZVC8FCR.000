#After all humans have been around for thousands and thousands of years, if not millions and in all that time had almost no technology. Where did this sudden burst in technological advances come from? I mean think about it. It wasn???t too long ago humans couldn t even fly and they didn t even have electricity. Where did this sudden surge of technology come from? And now there are trips to outer space like there are trips to the grocery store. Space travel has become routine. Sounds a little suspicious if you ask me.
