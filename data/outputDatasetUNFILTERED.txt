(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 487
Zinedine Zidane is better player than Ronaldo by far.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 488
Zinedine Zidane.Honestly,I don t think you should compare these two players because Zidane is a legend and C.Ronaldo is still so young,he has more to proves but seriously if he wants to be a legend like Zidane,he should stop diving.I like Zidane because although he is one of the best players,he still has such a down-to-Earth character,modest,shy,calm,patient,kind-hearted and loving.Look at his reactions when he scores a goal,he would look so humble.That s the true legend.And he also apologizes when he makes mistakes,like when he headbutted Materazzi,he sincerely apologized for it,and that s the best thing he did as a legendary football player and his apologies makes me say this:Zidane is a true football legend and he was,is and will always be a football legend.Live in peace,Zidane!

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is OCD ?
QUESTION CONTENT: does it have anything to do with Bi Polar?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2661
OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder.  It has absolutely nothing to do with bipolar disorder.  Most people think that OCD only covers the repeditive completeing of tasks or paranoia, but actually there are many branches of OCD.  There are the checkers, who repeatedly check things such as whether or not the locked their cars, there are the cleaners, who are petrified of germs and compulsively clean everything, there are the moral nuts who are constanly terrified of committing sins and there are the pure obsessionals, who have unwanted violent thoughts concerning death, suicide, murder, or sexual activities.  These are only some versions of OCD, and everyone who has it has a slightly different condition.  No one is sure exactly what causes OCD, although it is believed to be an imballance of chemicals in the brain, and seems to be hereditary.  OCD is a very prevalent disorder, although most forms of it are mild, and almost all forms are manageable with the propper tools.

Baltimore RavensIt s not the team I can t stand but the whiny, spoiled-children that are their fans, starting with the old-time Colt players.You failed to support the Colts.  You failed to sell out Memorial Stadium.  You refused to replace it or even upgrade it.  When the owner of the team went looking for more profitable surroundings you tried to steal the team via an illegal use of eminent domain.  You then have spent 23 years crying Boo-Hoo! and playing the victim since the team was moved.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is FAFSA?
QUESTION CONTENT: Is FAFSA a loan or a grant? And how do you get the federal pell grant and state grants? I m a single mom starting college in the fall. I was told I would be able to get alot of help with finances....HOW?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2563
Neither Loan or Grant The FAFSA (the Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is the first step in the financial aidprocess. You use it to apply for federal student financial aid, such as grants, loans and work-study. Inaddition, most states and schools use information from the FAFSA to award non-federal aid.Save time: File Electronically!Tips to Getting Aid Without Delay!We asked financial aid advisors from around the country what they would tell studentsfilling out their FAFSAs. Here???s what they said:Important: Read the form!Many questions on the FAFSA are straightforward, like your Social Security Number oryour date of birth. But many require you to read the instructions to make sure you answer thequestion correctly. Words like ???household,??? ???investments??? and even ???parent??? all have commonmeanings, but are specifically defined for purposes of federal student aid. So be sure to read theinstructions.You may have unique family situations that cause you to have additional questions. Youshould then contact a financial aid administrator at the school you wish to attend forclarification.Apply early.Deadlines for aid from your state, from your school, and from private sources tend to bemuch earlier than deadlines for federal aid. To make sure that any financial aid package yourschool offers you will contain aid from as many sources as possible, apply as soon as you canafter January 1, 2005.The U.S. Department of Education will process your 2005-2006 FAFSA if received on orbefore June 30, 2006. However, to actually receive aid, your school must have your correct,complete information before your last day of enrollment in the 2005-2006 school year. So it isimportant to apply early to make sure you leave enough time for your school to receive yourinformation and to make any necessary corrections.Complete your tax return.Filling out your tax return first will make completing the FAFSA easier. However, you donot need to submit your tax return to the IRS before you submit your FAFSA. But, once you(and your parents if you are a dependent student) file your tax return, you must correct anyincome or tax information that changed since you filed your FAFSA. Inaccurate informationon your FAFSA may delay your receipt of federal student aid. Also, you will be required toreturn federal aid you improperly received based upon incorrect information.You can fill out and submit your application through FAFSA on the Web atwww.fafsa.ed.gov. Electronic filing is the fastest and easiest way to apply for financial aid.It???s also more accurate because the information you enter in FAFSA on the Web will be edited,and we will call your attention to any errors or missing information. This reduces the chanceyour application might be rejected, or that you will need to correct your information later.Preventing errors means your school will receive your application sooner.If you have a U.S. Department of Education PIN (Personal Identification Number), you caneven sign FAFSA on the Web electronically. To request a PIN, visit www.pin.ed.gov. Yourparents can also request and use their own PINs to sign your FAFSA online. We encourage youto apply for a PIN prior to submitting your FAFSA, but if you don???t we???ll automatically send youone once we have processed your application.Ask: Do I need additional forms?The FAFSA is the one application for federal student aid. Many schools and states relysolely upon this information. However, your school or state may require you to fill out additionalforms. These additional forms may have deadlines that are earlier than the federal student aiddeadlines, so be sure to check with the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend.Good Luck.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Random?
QUESTION CONTENT: We base much of our world on random numbers.  But are they truely random?Like rolling a dice, if you did the roll the exact same as the first time (which is impossible, or highly improbible) you should get the same number.  So is this random?  Someone please diffine random for me (no dictionary definitions).
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 781
It sa very good question.Although random numbers are used colloqially to represent arbitrary but in a mathemetical model u cannot generate nondeterminism as we do in every day life.Even in a computer when a random number is generated it is generated by some previous state such as system time and using some algorithm onto it.Althoough it is fully deterministic. That is why u can t provide a choice in a mathemetical model like that in human mind because everything in it is predefined. However wat u have cited in ur example is not a random number it is the probability. If u want to get a six by rolling a dice it is a 1:6 chance that u will get six .However this is also not proved.But if u have enough time to make an infinite trials of throwing the dice then from general intution we can conclude u will end up with a 6:1 ratio for ur six.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2662
Meaning that each option has the same probability. Dice arent truly random, because 7 is more likely to come up than any other number.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2663
A fair die should in theory generate a random number for you between 1 and 6. I would define a random event as an event that cannot be deterministically determined.

QUESTION CONTENT: I ve just watched a BBC documentary, Walking with Cavemen . One of its conclusions for how&why humans differ from their ancestors and other animals is Imagination . So What is it?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 241
I would say that imagination is simply being able to visualise mentally a situation that may or may not happen to your self in your mind.I disagreee with BBC what seoerates us from animals is our ability to Empathise with others. Which is using imagination, to put ourself in others situations and understand what they feel.Empathy is probably our most evolved emotion, it makes us charitable, and gives us the ability as a species to develop futher still constantly. Empathy helps children develp into social beings.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1043
Imagination in my opinion is our ability to dream, our dreams are what leads humans to progress in life , example a child of 4 to 6 years old does not know that he cannot fly they believe that they can do anything until an adult tells him no he can t, it was his imagination that told him to fly , along comes an adult and Say s no and the child imagination as now got limits as to what he can imagine and not, the child(man) that invented the cell phone saw it for the first time on Star trek - when he became an adult he invented the mobile phone because as a child he dreamed of having one just like he saw as a child on Star Trek, he did not say i cannot dothat , he done it , do not limit your children instead encourage them to dream because our dreams are tommorrow s Reality. Todays Science fiction is tommorrow Reality.H.G Wells and Jules Verne are good examples most of the novels( Science Fiction) are fact today.!!! I hope that i have given an explanation that is understandable, as what is clear in my head can sometimes be so hard for me to explain to others, an excellent question by the asker!!!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1141
Kant establishes imagination as a mediator between sense perception and concepts, something between sense and thought. Knowledge of the phenomenal world, empirical knowledge, in made possible by the imagination as a power of spontaneous synthesis operating at the transcendental barrier of consciousness. It serves the conceptual understanding by providing schemata which enable the mind to grasp, or body forth , empirical objects. What he means by this is that our imagination is our spontaneous intuitive capacity to joins space and time. It puts together what is presented to us so as to form a coherent spatio-temporal experience which is intellectually ordered and sensually based.David Hume pictures imagination in terms of laws of association, but gives to it the transcendental function of providing those habits and customs without which human nature would perish and go to ruin .Our objects, our casual links, our sense of space and time, all our apprehensions of an objective world, are based upon strong imaginative associations, which by operating upon somehow-given discrete data saves us from chaos. We have a distinct inner, and we also have a distinct outer from which we extract out discreet data. That data is then cooked into the inner furnace of our imagination to mould together a distinctly associative world of our own - our heightened perception of the objective world around us in full consolidation with what we are, have been and are likely to be. This process is naturally spontaneous and very powerful. Normally it operate in complete harmony with other faculties of our rational mind. And it is very difficult to identify our self without imagining ourselves.There is also a concept of moral imagination. If you are touched by religion then you will be aware of a range of religious imagery ??? images of angles, visions of heaven, and pictures of hell. Where philosophy keeps its investigation well within the boundaries of reason and sensibility. All religions pay spacial attention to attend to the imaginative needs of their followers. In my opinion a religion tends to suggest ways and set principles for the management of the known and define the unknown. St Paul for example tells us to think about whatsoever things are honest, just, pure, lovely and of good report; Islam forbids all images depicting human figure, Judaism is weary of all images. All praise is attributive to God alone without any room for any doubt. I think there is great wisdom in this. Imagination is very personal to us all. Religious imagery whether it is imparted to us by world, or by picture is solely for the purpose of moral well-being of human kind. Imagination is very personal and important faculty in human mind. In our mind there is a distinct boundary between the outer and the inner of a person. Inside the mind our imagination goes beyond the domains of reason and sensibility.And in the outer world there are things we know and then there are things we have no been able to understand with the help of our scientific observation. Imagination goes on either side of this boundary. It fills the gaps left by our incomplete knowelge. Religion take good care of this. It constructs a harmonious and complete human mind that is capable to mange the known and define the unknown for the purpose of universal good .

Look around you every little thing started with imagination.All just ideas piled upon idea.No imagination, no computer, no sliced bread, really NOTHING!We would all be sleeping out side like cavemen!Imagination is caring.A cat, or a dog dont care.They just lay around the house all day and sleep.Imagine if they did care, they would be making things to better themselvees and the world.It would be a strange and odd world.We look to the sky and see the bird flying, we dont have wings so we imagine a way to obbtain wings.Every idea is a new imagination.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Mona Lisa?
QUESTION CONTENT: Best answer wins!
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2858
<The title Mona Lisa means Madam Lisa . It stems from Vasari s identification of the sitter as the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a wealthy Florentine businessman. Her name is known to have been Lisa. The alternative title La Gioconda is the feminine form of Giocondo. Coincidentally, in Italian giocondo means light-hearted ( jocund in English), so gioconda means light hearted woman . Because of her smile, this version of the title plays on this double-meaning, as in the French La Joconde .
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 230
Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda, is an oil painting on poplar wood by Leonardo da Vinci and is perhaps the most famous painting in Western art history; few other works of art are as romanticized, celebrated, or reproduced. It is owned by the French government and hangs in the Mus??e du Louvre in Paris.The painting shows a woman looking out at the viewer with what is described as an enigmatic smile .

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 181
The term Guerrilla was first used to describe the loose bands of Spanish irregular troops that resisted the invading French Armies of Napoeon Bonaparte. It literally refers to the little war (Guerre being Spanish for war), as opposed to the Big War of battalions and corps.Tactics will be ambushes of small numbers of enemy, and other sorts of thing where their fewer numbers can be brought to bear on a weak point.Soldiers will tend to be irregulars, or militia troops, although regular forces cut off behind lines may well engage in this type of warfare.Weapons: whatever comes to hand that can hurt the invader!Good Luck!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 716
Guerrilla warfare is the use of hit-and-run tactics by small, mobile groups of irregular forces operating in territory controlled by a hostile, regular force.The answer is 1. Tactics.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2407
It s simply refusing to fight like men: When British forces captured Charleston in 1780, American troops pulled out of South Carolina. [American military leader Francis]Marion, however, stayed and organized a small force of poorly equipped men, training them in guerrilla tactics. Living off the land, Marion and his men harassed British troops by staging small surprise attacks in which they captured small groups of British soldiers, sabotaged communication and supply lines, and rescued American prisoners. After these attacks Marion withdrew his men to swamp country unfamiliar to the British. Colonel Banastre Tarleton, a British commander, gave Marion his nickname when he complained that it was impossible to catch the swamp fox.

QUESTION CONTENT: Who is Irish Jack?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3053
There s not a Who fan who hasn t heard of him! Wacky, comical, and eccentric. Speed-freak skinny. 54! - the boy who never grew up. The original Mod from The Who s power base at the Goldhawk Social Club. Said by Pete Townshend to have been an influence on his past and continuing works, and cited as the inspiration for the classic Quadrophenia. Irish Jack - christened so by Who manager Kit Lambert during a night-of madness - first met The Who in 1962 when the band was still known as The Detours (playing a bunch of wedding dates in a half filled work diary), and he s been around ever since: pontificating on the attitude of Mod, eulogizing his Shepherd s Bush heroes, and sometimes eloquently tripping over backstage cable.Irish Jack reads his stories in London and New York, and always the theme is the same: growing up in Sixties London and keeping abreast of the only band he says, that ever mattered . All of his stories are true factual accounts, and he reads them with unreserved glee, celebrating his own survival and the times he lived in.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Amitabh Bachan?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2685
Amitabh Bachchan (born October 11, 1942, in Allahabad, India) also known as Big B, is an Indian actor whose Bollywood career has spanned over four decades.BiographyAmitabh was born to Teji and Harivansh Rai Bachchan . Harivansh Rai was a well known Hindi poet. Amitabh attended Boys High School in Allahabad followed by Sherwood College in Nainital and went on to Delhi University to earn a degree in science.Bachchan began making films in 1969 with Saat Hindustani. He became well known as a movie star in 1973, with the films Abhimaan and Zanjeer. While his popularity waned in the 1990s, Bachchan made a comeback in the early 2000s by hosting Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire .In 1982, Bachchan was injured while filming on the set of Coolie. He recovered and resumed making films. Popular interest in his injury had been so high that when Coolie was released, it featured a freeze-frame and caption, isolating the exact instant during a fight scene when Amitabh was hurt.Bachchan married actress Jaya Bhaduri in 1973. He has co-starred with Jaya in many films: Zanjeer, Abhimaan, Sholay, Silsila and, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. They have two children: Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan. Abhishek Bachchan has already followedhis father s footsteps, having starred in a number of recent movies

An Actor in India.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 221
The trademark deep baritone voice, the tall, brooding persona, and intense eyes, made Amitabh Bachchan the ideal Angry Young Man in the 1970s, thereby changing the face of Hindi cinema. The son of the late poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and Teji Bachchan, he was born in Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. After completing his education from Sherwood College, Nainital, and Kirori Mal College, Delhi University, he moved to Calcutta to work for shipping firm Shaw and Wallace. Later, he moved to Bombay and struggled for a while to get his foot in the door of the Hindi film industry. The lanky, dark, and intensely brooding persona did not go down well with directors who were looking for wise-cracking, fair, loverboys - the trademark of the Indian hero in the 1960s. Starting with the low key Saat Hindustani, Bachchan struggled through many roles and wasrelegated at times to doing voice-overs and in one instance playing a deaf-mute (his deep baritone voice might have overshadowed the other actors!). He broke through with Zanjeer (the Chain) in 1973 playing opposite his real-life love interest and future wife Jaya Bhaduri. His persona seemed apt for the 1970s, capturing the resentment of underemployed youth and the increasing cult of violence. Bachchan reworked the image of the Hindi film hero with major hits like Deewar, Sholay, Trishul, Don, Kala Patthar, and Shakti. Adapting former screen idol Dilip Kumar s mannerisms and adding his own flamboyance, he popularized the violent melodrama. He proved that he had an equal flair for tragedies (Deewar, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Shakti) and comedies (Chupke Chupke, Don, Naseeb, Amar Akbar Anthony) as well. His most memorable performance was as the renegade against a harsh society in Deewar. After Amar Akbar Anthony in which he reveled in the role of the Cathlolic bootlegger - he played similar masala roles, movies that required action, comedy, tragedy, and romance in one character. This had disastrous consequences later with movies disintegrating into Amitabh variety shows rather than plot-driven stories. Bachchan was dubbed the Superstar, taking over that title from Rajesh Khanna, something he hung on to until the mid 1980s when the floor widened after his temporary departure. At the height of his popularity he was injured in an accident while shooting for the film Coolie - long lines of people prayed for his recovery at the Breah Candy hospital, underscoring his megastar status. He left films in 1985 to become a Member of Parliament from Allahabad constituency as a Congress party candidate, as a favor to his family friend Rajiv Gandhi - the new Prime MInister of India. A report of involvement in financial irregularities (of which he was completely cleared later) made him decide to step down as MP. His return in 1987 was lukewarm as the Hindi film industry had moved on and newer, younger heroes essayed the part of Angry Young Man with more conviction. Bachchan seemed to have lost his heart in making films as his later roles did not show the flicker of passion that had marked earlier efforts in the 1970s. In 1989, for the first time since 1976, three of his films were flops i.e. they could not recover their money (in the Hindi film industry a flop is a film that does not recover a distributor s price, not the producer s cost). A series of lackluster films in the 1990s pointed to a long overdue exit, common to many other stars. A seemingly well-thought out venture to start a production company ABCL landed him in immense debts. Astonishingly, he burst back with a double act: one, playing the stern patriarch (the kind against which he had rebelled in the 1970s but which role was suited to his gravelly voice), and two, reinventing himself as a brand that in turn, could market anything. He began the latter by hosting the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Kaun Banegaa Crorepati) and is now back in demand for endorsements, advertisements as well as many movie roles. At sixty plus, Amitabh Bachchan is a greater icon than he was at the height of his popularity three decades ago. His son, Abhishek is considered a talented actor who has not yet broken out as a star

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Uncle Sam??What did he do? It s there really a real person that s called Uncle Sam??
QUESTION CONTENT:

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2771
US, that s all.All the stuff in the Army says US ARMY . Uncle Sam s.There is some noise that it was a derisive term that originated in the anti-war press during the war of 1812.No real person.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2772
Uncle Sam is a national personification of the United States dating from the War of 1812. Common folklore holds that his origins trace back to soldiers stationed in upstate New York, who would receive barrels of meat stamped with the initials U.S. The soldiers jokingly referred to it as the initials of the meat supplier, Uncle Samuel Wilson, of Troy, New York. The 87th United States Congress adopted the following resolution on September 15, 1961: Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives that the Congress salutes Uncle Sam Wilson of Troy, New York, as the progenitor of America s National symbol of Uncle Sam. A monument marks his birthplace in Arlington, Massachusetts. However, counter-arguments to this theory have been raised by some (for example, see Cecil Adams article at The Straight Dope) so the precise origin of the term may never be proven.Most earlier representative figures of the United States such as Brother Jonathan were overtaken by Uncle Sam somewhere around the time of the Civil War. The female personification Columbia has seldom been seen since the 1920s. Uncle Sam was first used in a political cartoon, drawn by the famous Thomas Nast. Today, with the possible exception of the Statue of Liberty, the character of Uncle Sam is probably the most easily recognizable personification of the U.S

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 533
wrongly asked:who was prophet Mohamed? rightly asked.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 950
Mohammad was born in Hejaaz, Arabian Peninsula. He was an ordinary person untill he reached his 40. All we know about his childhood is that his father died before he was born and his mother when he was still a child. He lived with his caretaker. He was famous for being honest righteous. Then at the age of 40, while he used to go to Hara cave--and no body knows why--one night he came down the cave and told his wife, Khadijeh, that he has been chosen by God as the prophet. I think a man called Mohammad existed literally but the question is how did he learn to read and write so articulately after that night. anyhow, he was the most ambitious prophet. He expanded Islam by sword as Francis Bacon says and he regularized polygamy. He had many wives at the same time even a familyless, nine-year-old girl who used to live with them. Well I think he civilized those barbaric arabs at that time. He was a radical, a non-conformist. But even a non-conformist is under the influence of the prevalent discourses of his own age as Michel Focault believes and I agree with him therefore he had to be violent in order to survive. He taught the arabs that they must not burry their infant girls. He was a feminist but a feminist belonging to 14 centuries before. feminism has changed during all these years. He taught the arabs to wash up 5 times a day to pray. you see? He was prettyradical, groundbreaking, and radical. The problem is that 1: his Islam is static, not Dynamic. Improving the rules of Islam and updating it is considered heresy. 2: He--just like every other prophet-- was not divine. He told white lies in his book. These white lies were useful at those times but not now. 3. He is outdated now. His philosophy and worldview cannot answer the needs and questions of the 21st century. 4. He was not secular.He served mankind but now he is dead and oght to be burried.

Before I give you what you ask, let me explain something.This universe was created balancely by God (do you believe in Him?), there is good and there is bad. In this question, there are the rationals and the irrationals. There are the ones who love Muhammad and know him and there are ones who simply hate him and not knowing fully about him.Get the picture?If you ask an irrational person about Muhammad, surely he or she will say all the bad things about him (Muhammad).But if you ask a rational person about Muhammad, he or she will say all the truth about Muhammad; without exclusion.However, in order to be rationally minded, we must sort out the strenght of proofs people say about Muhammad.If their reasons are lame and irrational, you know what to do.If it is vice versa, just accept the truth. No point cheating yourself.I will continue later, typing a brief history of a person is not easy.Name: Muhammad bin Abdullahborn c. 570, Mecca, Arabia or 12 Rabiul-Awal of the Year of the Elephantdied June 8, 632, MedinaFather: AbdullahMother: AminahArab prophet who established the religion of Islam.The son of a merchant of the ruling tribe, he was orphaned at age six. He married a rich widow, Khadijah, with whom he had six children, including Fatimah, a daughter. According to tradition, in 610 he was visited by the angel Gabriel, who informed Muhammad that he was the messenger of God. His revelations and teachings, recorded in the Qur an, are the basis of Islam. He began to preach publicly c. 613, urging the rich to give to the poor and calling for the destruction of idols. He gained disciples but also acquired enemies, whose plan to murder Muhammad forced him to flee Mecca for Medina in 622. This flight, known as the Hijrah, marks the beginning of the Islamic era. Muhammad s followers defeated a Meccan force in 624; they suffered reverses in 625 but repelled a Meccan siege of Medina in 627. He won control of Mecca by 629 and of all Arabia by 630. He made his last journey to Mecca in 632, establishing the rites of the hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. He died later that year and was buried at Medina. His life, teachings, and miracles have been the subjects of Muslim devotion and reflection ever since.Plus, the greatest man in history of the world.No wonder many people hate him unreasonably and many people are willing to die protecting his name.

Gerade die Person Muhammads (s) wurde in der langj??hrigen Geschichte der Missverst??ndnisse zwischen Orient und Okzident zu einem Punkt, der wesentliche, tiefe Vorurteile gegen??ber dem Islam und den Muslimen begr??ndete. Der Koran sieht Muhammad (s), den Gesandten Gottes, als eine Barmherzigkeit f??r alle Welten, ein Vorbild in allen Lebenslagen, als jemanden, der sich um das Schicksal der Menschheit sorgte und als einen Menschen, der in seinem Leben die Ergebenheit in Gott vorlebte und zu ihr aufrief. Im Gegensatz dazu wurde er im Abendland teilweise als falscher Prophet oder als Konkurrent zum Propheten Jesus (Friede sei auf ihm) dargestellt.Da wir genaue Aufzeichnungen und ??berlieferungen ??ber das Leben des Propheten Muhammad (s) und seine Zeit besitzen, k??nnen wir ohne viel M??he und Aufwand ein wahrheitsgetreues Bild von ihm zeichnen. Diese im Cordoba Verlag ver??ffentlichen Informationen sollen einen Beitrag dazu liefern, das verzerrte Bild zu korrigieren. Sie liefert kurze und einfache Antworten zu den wichtigsten Fragen, die in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder auftauchen. Wir hoffen hiermit zu einer Ann??herung von Menschen unterschiedlicher Lebensweise und zu einem Abbau von Falschinformation beitragen zu k??nnen.Much has been written about the Prophet Muhammad (saas), from indepth biographies by Muslim scholars and non-Muslim researchers to sayings upon sayings of others. Muhammad ibnu Abdillah was born in Mecca in the year 569 CE. He earned his living as a trader and was known by his people as al-amin (the trustworthy one). When Muhammad (saas) reached the age of 40, the angel Gabriel came to him with revelations that established his prophethood. Muhammad (saas) was first ordered to instruct his immediate family on Islam, including his beloved wife Khadija, but eventually it was revealed to him that he should begin delivering the message to all of mankind. In the next 20 years of his life, he communicated the message of Allah to his people, and set an example for how each human being should lead her or his life. This is especially valuable since Muhammad (saas) is the last Prophet of Allah. In the year 632, the year of his death, the Prophet delivered his famous last sermon. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Oil Refinery?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 894
An oil refinery is an industrial process plant where crude oil is processed and refined into useful petroleum products.OperationRaw oil or unprocessed ( crude ) oil is not very useful in the form it comes in out of the ground. It needs to be broken down into parts and refined before use in a solid material such as plastics and foams, or as petroleum fossil fuels as in the case of automobile and airplane engines.Oil can be used in so many various ways because it contains hydrocarbons of varying molecular masses and lengths such as paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes (or cycloalkanes), alkenes, dienes, and alkynes.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2760
Depends upon whether you are talking about mineral oil or edible oil.  Each of these is different.Refining mineral oil cleans it and then reacts it (cracking) to get molecules which are smaller and more useful (gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, etc.) than those found in crude oil from the ground.Refining edible oil removes the free fatty acids from the crude extracted oil and then bleaches and deodorizes it.

The probability would then be zero because the resulting decimal is imfathomably small.Meaning: don t take infinity seriously, he s just a big joke.

Baseball is by far my favorite sport. I pretty much like everything about it. I like how unpredictable it is. A pitcher could throw a no-hitter one day and then his next outing give up five runs in the first inning. Also, a lot of people complain that baseball is boring because it is so slow-paced. That s one of the main things I like about the sport. One at-bat can take almost 5 minutes. It builds the tension and you are just waiting for that homerun or strike out.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Pilomatrix Carcinoma?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2964
Pilomatrix Carcinoma:Pilomatrixoma, also known as pilomatricoma, and calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, is an uncommon benign tumor of hair matrix origin.  Malherbe and Cheantais first described the lesion in 1880 and originally believed the lesion was a benign tumor of the sebaceous glands.  The lesions typically occur on the head and neck and are more common in females.  There are two peaks of occurrence with age.  The first is before the third decade, with greater than 60% occurring at this time.  The second is during the sixth and seventh decades (3).  Histologically, pilomatrixomas are characterized by irregularly shaped islands of small basaloid epithelial cells.  The basaloid cells generally have small uniform nuclei and scant cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders surrounded by fibrillary material.  Also often noted are a variable degree of squamous differentiation and sheets of ghost cells that occasionally are mixed with stroma containing multinucleated giant cells.  Calcifications may or may not be conspicuous.  Pilomatrix carcinoma is an exceedingly rare locally aggressive and destructive tumor that usually arises from a pilomatrixoma.    Bony invasion and occasional distant metastases have been reported (2).  The carcinoma is more common in males than females, with a ratio of 2:1 in a review of 72 cases in the literature (2).  Imaging studies such as MRI or CT may be useful to evaluate pilomatrix carcinoma that does not respond to wide local excision with negative margins.  Histologically, Pilomatrix carcinoma is characterized by more numerous and atypical mitoses, nuclear atypia, tumor necrosis, and infiltration into subcutaneous fat, blood vessels, nerve and muscle.  Aggressive wide local excision is required for treatment.

QUESTION SUBJECT: do you like this poem i wrote?
QUESTION CONTENT: first i have to say this is just a poem. im not the devil.be honest but try and be nice.Unspoken words can say so muchMy insanity reached its limitThe air thickensAs we speakMy heart beats two times Too fastI cry myself to sleepSatan has reachedMy turning point From pure sweet to Pure EvilThe thoughts Those now rush through my head Are not the thoughtsOf an angelBut more the thoughts Of a teenage devilFeeding off of Others fake innocenceGetting strongerAt every breath I take. I blink my eyes To the beat of the devils drumI hold back tearsNot needed in this worldI used to think the answer was toRun away from my problemsNow I know to face themWith the strength Satan gave meWishing I could release this evilBecome pure yet again But such doesn???t happen to The good girl Gone bad
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2252
Your emotion is clear, but you are mixing way to many metaphors. First line, talking about unspoken words communicating, nice. Second line, it s insanity. Pretty soon Satan turns up and sweet turns to evil, then an angel and the devil, devils drums. Back to Satan again.Try to compress it and trim it. If you can say the same thing with fewer style jumps and fewer words, it ll have much more impact. There s the silence/words/breaths, heartbeats/eyes/tears stuff, then all the devil/satan and 1 angel, and also stuff about communicating, others feeding, running away or facing problems. I d try using the first set, where you focus on personal and physical things: breaths, silence, heartbeats, tears. See if there s a shorter, punchier poem there. Now take the angel&devils, Satan and good girl gone bad, that sounds like a different poem to me, once again a shorter poem with more impact.I m not fond of single word lines, either. Breaks up the rhythm, so I can t tell if you re getting a good meter or not.Keep working on it and polishing it, I admire your bravery in putting your personal work out there and asking for criticism, now use that to improve it!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 126
The resignation and yet struggle that conflicts you, comes thru very pointedly.  You get your message across.     But it really isn t very poetic.  There s no real beauty to it.  Your punctuation is almost none existent.  And your poem has no form to it: very little rhyme, and a non-existent format.     You said to be honest, but nice.  I ve critiqued it to the best of my ability; I hope that I haven t hurt your feelings: I did not mean to do so.      Do I like it? Bottom line: no.     So,I would recommend that you take a formal course in poetry: learn what it is, and what it is not.                                            Alberich

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Descartes?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2813
the father of modern philosophy.  His famous quote is i think therefore i am .  he started by doubting everything, claiming that he could not be sure of anything because it could be a dream or the work of a demon influeincing his mind.  the only thing he could be sure of is that his mind exists, because he is capable of thought.  he also is known for his dualism- separation of the physical body from the spiritual/mental mind.  if you need any more info consult wikipedia.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 924
I think therefore I am
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 925
 Ren?? Descartes (IPA: /de??ka??t/, March 31, 1596 ??? February 11, 1650), also known as Cartesius, was a noted French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. Dubbed the Founder of Modern Philosophy and the Father of Modern Mathematics, he ranks as one of the most important and influential thinkers of modern times. For good or ill, much of subsequent western philosophy is a reaction to his writings, which have been closely studied from his time down to the present day.Descartes founded 17th century continental rationalism, later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and opposed by the empiricist school of thought, consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley&Hume. Leibniz, Spinoza and Descartes were all versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed significantly to science as well. As the inventor of the Cartesian coordinate system, Descartes founded analytic geometry, that bridge between algebra and geometry crucial to the invention of the calculus and analysis. Descartes s reflections on mind and mechanism began the strain of western thought that much later, impelled by the invention of the electronic computer and by the possibility of machine intelligence, blossomed into, e.g., the Turing test and John Searle s Chinese room argument.His most famous statement is Cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am.). 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1618
He is the man who tried to find God by rationalism and he failed. The best he could do was come up with I think therefore I am .  You can only find God by faith in His Son Jesus Christ, that He died for your sins on the cross.

Ihate neither but Jimmie Johnson is annoying beyond words. No comparison with Jeff cause he s a 4 (should be 5) time champion, raced with the BEST (R.Petty and Dale Earnhardt) and represents corporate nascar without coming off as cocky and smugly smooth as his pupil does.

QUESTION CONTENT: I am new to VA and I can not find a school for my teen who is ADHD, among other things, and is failing school again.  Public school does not look like an option anymore. I don t know what I can afford. I am struggling as it is but he needs help.  Any suggestions Yahoo! community?Hello Everyone and thanks for your input. Yes my son has been diagonsed with ADHD.  He was first diagnosed when he was 7 or 8.  Since then he has been on meds (different types) which helped some.  Becuase of the side effects I choose to take him off altogether.  I found that although he was on meds he still had problems with his behavior and doing well in school, paying attention, completing assignments ( when I say well I don t mean an A student. I mean just passing his grades)  I have looked in military schools and he is in a special ed class now.  Which has not been much help either.  He is in therapy and I have made appt with a psych analyst to have him tested yet again.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 753
Glossary:DSM -- the book psychiatrists use which contains possible diagnoses (labels) and their descriptions, from extreme [most commonly seen]to variations, with a limit on how many general-to-specific variations it will list.You ve got to understand that mental illness according to the diagnostical statistical manual is a misleading guide because it only includes the characteristics that tend to occur, and the label groups those characteristics together.So, supposing you had a psychiatrist and reported some of the symptoms under the DSM, he/she may not decide you should be diagnosed with OCD, but still think you have some thoughts that resemble compulsive thinking. Use of the DSM is not designed for patients, and does not contain sufficient information about how likely or common a specific diagnosis is, and does not contain information about variations on the textbook case to be useful to a patient trying to compare the symptoms listed in the DSM to their everyday life.Medical doctors have a basic understanding of behavioral health. If you are worried about it, or worried about a friend, you should have them see their primary care doctor, and ask for a referral to a cognitive behavioral therapist who can through talk therapy -- and sometimes medication if it is deemed necessary -- help them or you understand your thought process more clearly. The doctor will keep what you say confidential as required by law.The DSM will certainly guide their decision-making, and you should report every behavior that might be relevant. Pre-diagnosing means that you will tend to not fully explain, and be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or overdiagnosed.Just act like yourself, and leave the psychological knowledge up to your doctor.I have provided the following sources:--SamP.S You may have to specifically ask for a therapist, because some doctors will send you to a stabilization ward , which may or may not connect you with a therapist.

PAT is paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. The terminology may be confusing. There are several types of tachycardias. That just means a fast heart beat. A. (atrial) fib(rillation) is a supraventricular rhythm (the atria is above or superior to the ventricle) and it can cause tachycardia. PAT is an atrial or supraventricular tachycardia (because the atria is above the ventricle). PAT is characterized by sudden burst, or paroxysms, of tachycardias or rapid heart beats. This can manifest as palpitations, where you get the sensation of your heart pounding, dizziness, shortness of breath, and sweating.Sometimes treatment isn t necessary if symptoms are mild.  Medications and ablation (selective electrical destruction of heart tissue) are possible treatments.See the link for more info. I m a physician.

It is a very strange situation isn t it ? My parents don t know about this and are fine with me now, but I know.. and when they smile at me and I smile back.. there is this knowledge behind my smile. Very confusing situation that I don t even know how to behave and how to see this. I am still nice to them, they haven t done anything bad to me so far. The future will come later. But even then.. I don t like to hate anyone. It is also my life that gets ruined this way. But at the same time.. suppressing strong feelings isn t a good solution either. Any kind of suppression leads to some kinds of mental or/and physical blockings..Sorry if this doesn t sound like what you were asking. I just felt like sharing this.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is ASD? what precautionns to be taken while dental treatement?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2940
An ASD is an atrial septal defect, which is a heart defect (specifically, a hole in your heart between your right and left atria).  With a secundum type ASD (most common type), no precautions need to be taken before dental treatment.  However, you may have other heart defects that do require antibacterial precautions before dental treatment so it is important to ask both your primary care doctor and your dentist before proceeding with the treatment.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2941
ASD -Theseptum is a wall that separates the heart s left and right sides. Septal defects are sometimes called a hole in the heart. A defect between the heart s two upper chambers (the atria) is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). When there is a large defect between the atria, a large amount of oxygen-rich (red) blood leaks from the heart s left side back to the right side. Then this blood is pumped back to the lungs, despite already having been refreshed with oxygen. This is inefficient, because already-oxygenated blood displaces blood that needs oxygen. Many people with this defect have few, if any, symptoms.For info. on dental care please visit:http://www.bracesinfo.com
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2942
ASD is Atrial Septal Defect, which simply means that there is a hole in the wall separating 2 atria, the upper chambers of the heart.  This leads to mixing of the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.  A person usually suffers less due to ASD as oxygenated blood goes to deoxygenated blood chamber and mixes (and not viceversa).Wall of the heart has 4 layers.  The innermost layer is called endocardium. In patients with any congenital heart disease (including ASD), this endocardium is vulnerable to infection with blood borne bugs.  These bugs get access into blood whenever a person undergoes any operation or procedure (like dental treatment).  Hence prophylactic antibiotic therapy is a must before dental treatment in people with ASD (or any other congenital heart disease).  Check this link to the american heart association website, which speaks about endocarditis prophylaxis.  I think this should answer all your questions

QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3021
Because even people who control their food get cancer. No one is immune. There are over 200 different types of cancer and no one knows why one person will get a cancer while another one will not. No one knows why a five year old child will get Neuroblastoma . . while a 60 year old will get liver cancer. It is has almost nothing to do with the food you eat. People want to believe that it is the food because than it makes them feel that they have some type of control over the disease. But if it was as simple as controlling the food . . than everyone would do it and there would be no cancer.

Whatever can change is just a truth of that moment. Real truth must not change ever. Such truth therefore can not be bound by time, for whatever is bound by time has a starting point and an ending point which denotes changes. Truth therefore is timeless. We are bound by time, therefore we can not transcend into timelessness. Therefore it is my submission that the real or everlasting truth can not be known to us... we can only imagine it conceptually.The truth that we are privy to are what we believe to be true. Such truth obviously has to be found in our own self, within our own being. Even though these are not everlasting truths, these are the most important ones concerning ourselves.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Tachycardia?
QUESTION CONTENT: I read that i might have it. been having fast heart rate
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 1495
This topic will help you out:Ventricular tachycardia is a heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles and produces a heart rate of at least 120 beats per minute.Ventricular tachycardia may be thought of as a sequence of consecutive ventricular premature beats. Sometimes only a few such beats occur together, and then the heart returns to a normal rhythm. Ventricular tachycardia that lasts more than 30 seconds is called sustained ventricular tachycardia. Sustained ventricular tachycardia usually occurs in people with structural heart disease that damages the ventricles. Most commonly, it occurs weeks or months after a heart attack. It is more common among older people. However, rarely, ventricular tachycardia develops in young people who do not have structural heart disease.Symptoms and DiagnosisPeople with ventricular tachycardia almost always have palpitations. Sustained ventricular tachycardia can be dangerous because the ventricles cannot fill adequately or pump blood normally. Blood pressure tends to fall, and heart failure follows. Sustained ventricular tachycardia is also dangerous because it can worsen until it becomes ventricular fibrillation???a form of cardiac arrest. Sometimes ventricular tachycardia causes few symptoms, even at rates of up to 200 beats per minute, but it may still be extremely dangerous.Electrocardiography  Electrocardiography) is used to diagnose ventricular tachycardia and to help determine whether treatment is required. A portable ECG (Holter) monitor may be used to record heart rhythm over a 24-hour period.TreatmentVentricular tachycardia is treated when it causes symptoms or when episodes last more than 30 seconds even without causing symptoms. Sustained ventricular tachycardia often requires emergency treatment. If episodes cause blood pressure to fall to a low level, cardioversion is needed immediately. Drugs may be given intravenously to end or suppress ventricular tachycardia. The most commonly used drugs are lidocaineSome Trade NamesXYLOCAINE, procainamideSome Trade NamesPROCAN SRPRONESTYL, and amiodaroneSome Trade NamesCORDARONE.Certain procedures may be performed to destroy the small abnormal area in the ventricles, identified by ECG, that is usually responsible for sustained ventricular tachycardia. They include radiofrequency ablation (delivery of energy of a specific frequency through an electrode catheter inserted in the heart) and open-heart surgery.If other therapy is ineffective, an automatic defibrillator (a small device that can detect an arrhythmia and deliver a shock to correct it) may be implanted. This procedure is similar to implantation of an artificial pacemaker.

Tachycardia means faster than average heart rate.  Average is the key word.  Whether or not it s a problem depends on a lot of things.If you are seeing someone medical about it, good. If not you probably should, just to be on the safe side.Ventricular tachycardia and atrial (whatI imagine you are having) are two different things.Atrial tachycardia by itself does _not_ cause v tach.

Kennedy.Garrison remains a controversial figure; opinions differ as to whether he uncovered the actual conspiracy behind the John F. Kennedy assassination but was blocked from successful prosecution by Federal government coverup, whether he bungled his chance to uncover the truth of the conspiracy, or whether the entire case was a wild goose chase motivated by Garrison s alleged desire for publicity.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Which do you like better, glasses or contacts?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2681
Glasses by far. Contacts irritate my eyes too much, they get dried out, and if you even get a speck of dust in them it s insane to try and get rid of the irritation, especialy if a strand of your hair flops into one of them! They re too expensive and too much trouble, I prefer accesorizing with my cute glasses :POh and if you ever have a cold you have to be super careful wearing your contacts (or just not wear them) or else you get pink eye, and often times you have to replace your contacts after that, just in case, and that s something I can t afford to do much.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 800
I do not know..I have neither...but if I did I would wear contacts..
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 801
I have both, I prefer contacts because they are more convient. I hate wearing glasses so I only use mine if I run out of contacts or if my eyes are to tired or irritated for my contacts. You can also get contacts that are tinted or colored which makes them fun to play around with. I think of them more as an accessory rather than a burden which is how i think of my glasses.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 802
Hard Contacts clinged too well to my eyes.  Twas a real pain digging them out at night (No!  they would not simply pop out like they were supposed to).Soft Lenses?  well, I got tired of the cleaning ritual, and I worked a lot with landscaping.Wore Glasses for over 30 years.  Got tired of that too.So, I paid for laser surgery.  Wow!  Am sooooo glad that I did!!!!!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 803
I hate the way I look in glasses and I think that most people look better naturally. So I opt for contacts. They re not uncomfortable at all, if you take care of them properly. Also, I didn t like that when I wore glasses, I wasn t able to see well outside of the glasses. If I looked up or down or to the far right or left, I wouldn t be able to see well.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 804
I am only slightly near sighted, so I can still get around without either, but I felt weird in glasses and went straight to contacts, and I hate them! They hurt, and make my eyes feel like I ve been up too long. I ve only tried one brand, and I haven t ruled out astigmatism, but thats only because I can t afford anything right now. I will get glasses as soon as I can pay for them, but right now I dont wear anything. I only wear my contacts when I go to the shooting range, and thats only for a couple tolerable hours. =)

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS CALLED SILENT KILLER- You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without a single symptom. But silence isn t golden. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke.Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure.High blood pressure typically develops without signs or symptoms. And it affects nearly everyone eventually. If you don t have high blood pressure by age 55, you have a 90 percent chance of developing it at some point in your life, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it.In 90 percent to 95 percent of high blood pressure cases, the American Heart Association says there s no identifiable cause. This type of high blood pressure, called essential hypertension or primary hypertension, tends to develop gradually over many years.The other 5 percent to 10 percent of high blood pressure cases are caused by an underlying condition. This type of high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Various conditions can lead to secondary hypertension, including kidney abnormalities, tumors of the adrenal gland or certain congenital heart defects.Certain medications ??? including birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs ??? also may cause secondary hypertension. In a 2005 study, women who took an average of 500 milligrams or more of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) daily over several years were more likely to develop high blood pressure than were women who didn t take any acetaminophen. It s not known if the same holds true for men.Various illicit drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines, also can increase blood pressure.-

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Chaos Theory? Explain in your own words?
QUESTION CONTENT: Your own words only! I can search google if i want to. I need someone to make me understand what i Chaos Theory all about?dstandfi.. just shut up and mind your own business.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 760
What exactly is chaos? The name chaos theory comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data. When was chaos first discovered? The first true experimenter in chaos was a meteorologist, named Edward Lorenz. In 1960, he was working on the problem of weather prediction. He had a computer set up, with a set of twelve equations to model the weather. It didn t predict the weather itself. However this computer program did theoretically predict what the weather might be. One day in 1961, he wanted to see a particular sequence again. To save time, he started in the middle of the sequence, instead of the beginning. He entered the number off his printout and left to let it run. When he came back an hour later, the sequence had evolved differently. Instead of the same pattern as before, it diverged from the pattern, ending up wildly different from the original. (See figure 1.) Eventually he figured out what happened. The computer stored the numbers to six decimal places in its memory. To save paper, he only had it print out three decimal places. In the original sequence, the number was .506127, and he had only typed the first three digits, .506.   ...(c this site)

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 761
Believe it or not my interest in this topic stems from watching the movie Jurassic Park. After I heard about Chaos Theory, I started to research into it. However, being a social scientist, I wanted a clear explanation that I could understand. Here is what I was able to compile.Chaos Theory is a dramatic new science that has forever changed the way we look at Nature, and indeed reality itself. Phrases like The devil s in the details or What you don t know can kill you are good starting points for understanding Chaos Theory. Simply put, throughout the history of Science, scientists have traditionally used neat formulas to explain natural phenomena; everything from steam boiling from your kettle to the movement of planets. They were approximately correct. Until recently, the computing power simply did not exist to solve more complex problems with any degree of accuracy. However, the world is not a simple neat formula. It is far more complex. Indeed, it is precisely what you do NOT know about any given natural system that can lead to your prediction about it eventually being a million miles away from reality. Scientists call this sensitive dependence upon initial conditions . In plain English, it means that unless you know EVERYTHING about a system to the nth degree, your prediction of it will eventually go astray as time elapses. The chaos/disorder in the system will eventually overwhelm the order predicted by your equations. This is why weather forecasts are frequently incorrect. It is also why economists, no matter how expert they pretend to be, can never predict the stock markets accurately, no matter how much information they have at their disposal. The fact that the data available on these, and other highly complex systems, is not INFINITE, is precisely why they can never be predicted for long. Nature is mostly non-linear , and Chaos Theory seeks to describe this. An example of a linear system is a billiard ball. Give it a light push and it moves slowly for a short distance. Give it a stronger push, and it moves faster and further. In non-linear systems, the feedback can far exceed the input. An example of non-linear feedback is stock market activity. Markets are not intrinsically dependent upon fundamental real world factors. Opinions, rumor and overall market sentiment are frequently bigger factors in moving the markets than the actual economics of the nation. That is one reason why crashes happen. The negativity leads to selling, which leads to more negativity, which leads to even more selling. This is the non-linear feedback effect.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Nestor Vinluan?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2610
When 54-year-old Filipino sculptor Nestor Vinluan deferred his visit here partly because of the Sars outbreak, the 73-year-old artist blithely agreed to be the artist-in-residence at Sculpture Square in Middle Road. That was in the first week of last month when the Sars scare was overtaking Singapore. But Ahmad was not fazed: People were panicking. But like anything else, if you don t take care of yourself, you will fall ill. On Tuesday, his official tenure as artist-in-residence ended, after 3 1/2 weeks. An American citizen since 1956, he moved from Connecticut in the United States to Kuala Lumpur three months ago. Preparing to move to Singapore for three weeks was not easy for him. In Malaysia, he tried in vain to look for a lorry driver to transport a dozen of his sculptures across the Causeway. Many refused to take the job because of fears of Sars. In the end, a Singaporean friend helped him to find a driver willing to make the trip from Johor Baru to Singapore. His Islam faith and a spartan lifestyle keeps him spry and healthy. He can single-handedly carry his 3.6m-tall aluminium sculptures around. Sculpture Square s general manager, Ms Tay Swee Lin, in her 30s, said: These days, it s very depressing. Everybody is staying away from exhibition openings.We got a great morale boost when Ahmad said he wanted to come and take up residency. The artist himself is glad he came. Besides sharing his expertise with art students here, he also got exposure which hopefully can translate into more sales and commissions of his work. He said: It was mutually beneficial. Ahmad Osni Peii s exhibition at Sculpture Square (155 Middle Road, Tel: 6333-1055) is on till June 1. Opening hours: 11 am to 6 pm (Monday to Friday), noon to 6 pm (Saturday and Sunday). Closed on public holidays. Admission is free.

QUESTION SUBJECT: do you like the book wuthering heights?
QUESTION CONTENT: personally, i loved it, but my friend hated. did you like it or dislike it, and why?10 points to best answer!
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 185
I LOVE Wuthering Heights .  Actually, I m a little bit obsessed with that book. (OK...more than a little bit.) lol.  It was given to me as a present by my Aunt when I was twelve years old, and there was just *something* about it that really, really fascinated me.  Of course, at twelve years old, I wasn t able to really and fully understand the deeper meanings in the book, but I still loved it.  I ve read it about once a year since then...and not to give away my age, but that would be over twenty times now.  (And every time I read it, I discover new things.  It s almost like Emily Bronte s ghost snuck in there and added detail in between readings.)As to what I love so much about it...it s hard to put my finger on any one specific thing.  I think...it s just so different than anything else I ve ever read.  It s a completely original idea, especially for books from that era.  The characters are unlike anything you find in any other books.  Sure, there are a lot of romantic books from that time, but not many of them where the hero and heroine of the book are at the least *unlikeable* people, and at the worst outright monsters.  The book just delves so much deeper into the psyches of the characters that it brings the characters to life in a way I had never before nor since seen, and the story is so much more rich and complex than anything else I ve ever read.  I almost need to remind myself that these characters are fictional, because they feel so real.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 186
I loved Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte; I really LIKED Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte.In my estimation, Emily Bronte s book was a bit more melodramatic and Gothic than Charlotte s.  I found Jane Eyre (the character) admirable, strong, independent and full of depth and substance.  Cathy was neither as strong, nor did I think she was as real.  It annoyed me a bit when she acted like the proverbial deer caught in the headlights in that she didn t seem to understand, fully, WHY Heathcliff was doing what he was doing.Heathcliff was so full of anger and a desire for revenge that he became slightly irritating.  Rochester, on the other hand, seemed like a real man, full of contradictions and torment; someone whom you might meet in real life.I think the difference between the two is, in part, the fact that Emily Bronte makes the book s setting almost as a central character and Charlotte Bronte draws a picture that revolves around those who people her book (the setting lends something to the story but is not THE story, if that makes sense).However, Wuthering Heights is a classic and rightfully so.  It is merely a darker and bleaker story with darker themes than Jane Eyre and has characters with whom you can t entirely sympathize.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2441
I loved the book but hated Heathcliff. He s so vengeant! It s like I had a sucky childhood because the girl I loved rejected me so I m gonna marry her sister-in-law and force her daughter to marry my son, even though they re COUSINS!!! The book was well written- like anything from that era (love Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters). I liked the ending. It wasn t comepletely happy, but it wasn t miserable and at least poor Catherine had some chance at happiness. p.s.- have you read Hard Times by Dickens? We re reading it in class and I just feel so sorry for poor Louisa. Her dad s using her to move up the social totem pole, her brother s using her to manipulate his boss, Bounderby likes her even though he s 50 and she s 20, and no one cares about her happiness. It s so sad!!!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2442
Well, I certainly think it s a very good book, a powerful piece of writing, with memorable characters, dramatic plot and strong dialogue.  However, it is not really to my taste, because I tend to like cheeerful books more.  For that reason I tend to like the second part of the book better, even though it is generally considred weaker than the first part, because it has a cheeerful outcome, with young Cathy and Hareton (I think that shis name, isn t it?) finding happiness together.  But when it comes to classic fiction I m afraid I m really more of a Jane Austen fan really.  But i certainly think it is a great novel.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2443
No.  I disliked it.  I had no sympathy at all for any of the characters, they were all unlikeable.  The story left me feeling disturbed and depressed.On the other hand, I really liked Jane Eyre, written by Emily Bronte s sister Charlotte.  I could relate to those characters and I had sympathy for them.  I actually cared what became of them.  It was, in my opinion, a much better book.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2526
I thought I would like it more than I did.  Honestly, Heathcliff was a bit of an A-hole and Catherine a spoiled brat.  I found myself not really caring too much about their unrequited love.

QUESTION SUBJECT: I m writing a book; how do you like this analogy?
QUESTION CONTENT: Pulling off the dress with a franticness that suggested the persona of a panic stricken stripper, Avinae rushed to make a hasty exit. This girl is in a dressing room, and she is trying to hurry up (haha, I thought i should explain that in case any of you are confused as to why she is pulling off a dress).I just want to know if this sentence makes sense, if you like it, if it s funny, or if you think it s stupid. Thanks!Hmm. I like the analogy, but I agree in that the sentence is too wordy (and a bit confusing), so I ll probably say:Pulling off the dress in a frenzy, Avinae rushed to make an exit.Does make an exit work? or should I just say, leave ?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 206
I don t.It seems redundant.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2114
It doesn t work. Strippers don t work fast. Slow is the idea. How about pulling off the dress like it was on fire? or Pulling off the dress like she just got caught trying on her sister s wedding gown? I really don t think the stripper thing works. Pax-C
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2115
I m guessing you mean this little slice of life to be funny(it made me laugh anyway) and there s only one thing I d change.Instead of franticness(which I m pretty sure isn t a word,but nice try)replace it with frenzy and read it back to yourself.It s funnier,right?Oh! And I liked the simile a panic-stricken stripper great alliteration(hyphenate panic-strickentoo) and the image is delightful!You can see her,tugging and twisting out of the dress(probably ripping it into the bargain)but you don t have to even say that.Yoyur reader will see it happening(like I did!)Keep this up!It s good!TL
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2116
The idea of the sentence is ravishing but something s wrong here. Stripper s aren t supposed to be in a hurry or supposed to be fast. The whole idea is for them to be sloowww. Good luck writing the book anyways! (By the way, what s the title and is it going to be published?)

It was widely praised as an accurate and sensitive portrait of growing up Chicano.It became famous for another reason years later.  It turned out the author, Danny Santiago, didn t exist, and was just a pseudonym for an older White man named Danny James.  This prompted lots of questions about what constitutes authenticity in a novel.You can find the book on Amazon, and around.

Physiognomy (Gk. physis, nature and gnosis, knowledge) is a pseudoscience, based upon the belief that the study and judgement of a person s outer appearance, primarily the face, reflects their character or personality. Up until the time of English King Henry VIII, its validity was so widely assumed that it was taught in universities and was an everyday concept that had developed into a regular Middle English word spelled fisnamy or visnomy. After that time, scholastic leaders settled on the more erudite form physiognomy and began to discourage the whole idea of fisnamy .

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Atrio Venus Malformation?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 6
Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects of the circulatory system that are generally believed to arise during embryonic or fetal development or soon after birth.  Although AVMs can develop in many different sites, those located in the brain or spinal cord can have especially widespread effects on the body.  Most people with neurological AVMs experience few, if any, significant symptoms.  The malformations tend to be discovered only incidentally, usually either at autopsy or during treatment for an unrelated disorder. Medication can often alleviate general symptoms such as headache, back pain, and seizures caused by AVMs and other vascular lesions. However, the definitive treatment for AVMs is either surgery or focused irradiation therapy.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is SSI? And people work if they have a dissability like have stage 4 cancer?
QUESTION CONTENT: I would just like more information on it.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2
SSI is supplemental security insurance.  This is what I received the first 6 months I was disabled with my cancer.  It came from the state level, not federal, and I barely received 300 a month.  It is a temporay benefit, I believe in my state you can only recieve it for that initial 6 months.  Ppl who are considered disabled or have workers comp issues qualify.  I was left homeless and unable to pay bills, and as you ppl know 300 a month doesnt cut it. I was also qualified for state medicaid med insurance.  After 6 months, I was eligible for ssd, social security disability payments.  My payments about doubled, and get raised by about 50 each year for cost of living.  This is year 3.  And as everyone knows, that amount still doesnt cover it.  I was lucky to have family in my area that let me live with them initially, and now I live with my sig other.  There is no way I can financially support myself entirely.  Even though I am considered permenatly disabled, my state will not approve section 8 housing, and they barely give me 10 a month in food stamps.  After 24 months from my original date of diagnosis, I was eligible for medicare.  So now my med insurance combines medicaid, aarp, and medicare.  Who wouldve thought, I am only 24, and have better public insurance that my grandmother.. lol.The social security website is hard to navigate, but the have a huge faq section.  Try to read what you can.  If you are considering applying for this, then you need to go talk to your local social security office, as well as your local public health dpt.As far as working, Im guessing your doc has suggested you dont, however I know you may need to.  If you are on public benefits, it is honestly best to try to work under the table if you can.  They wil tell you that you must report all work within 10 days of starting.  You will have to report if you have a normal tax paying job.  And with taking and reporting this normal tax paying job, you will loose your benefits.  If you work under the table there is no way they will find out (assuming you are quiet about it..  dont go running your mouth about it to someone who will turn you in).  I wanted to work, and I wanted to do it legally.  I called my local offices to find out what my restrictions were.  Once I finally got someone that would answer me (they dont like to give out this kind of info, bc a lot of ppl will use it to take advantage of the system), according to their formula, I could only gross 150$ a month and keep my benefits, namely the insurance.  So, i got a nanny position under the table.  Didnt really matter, I relapsed and had to quit 4 months later.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 274
go to the social security website and read the information.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1706
go to the SSA website that s already in one of your answers you don t have to be crazy crazy but they will send you to their psych and being severely depressed about your health and life goes a loooong way in getting you approved. And you have to have the complete cooperation of your doctors. what does that mean? You need to know what they have written in the medical records because what they write can be minimized or a cooperating doctor will maximize for you. The doctor can give the dire straits that you are in or they can write a ho hum that will get you denied before you get to the psych. So you need to work with your doctor. This is important because once you get denied you will be advised to get a SS lawyer which is an unnecessary evil if your doctors don t minimize your condition.writing or saying stage 4 cancer is not enough the paper pushers really don t care, they see this stuff on paper everyday. The other thing you needto know is if you are approved and they give you Medicare any med insurance you have automatically becomes secondary.

i dislike Drogba not for how he play the game but everything other than that, the old i can do no wrong, no foul can be given against Chelsea etc etc.Also Barton just because he thinks hes all that when to be honest what has he actually achieved, statring for Man City when tehy were shit and a jail sentance, congratulation.Ye Mikel annoys me, Man Utd really dodged a bullet thereAlso Sissoko for his pure lack of ability in passing shooting and everything else that isn t tackiling. And still Juve want him???Lucas aswel as i believe he is massivly over rated, i mean Liverpool go on about his passing and that but i have never seen him make a pass longer than 5 yards, and you can say it keeps their game flowing but surely for a premiership club you need to do more than pass 5 yards consistantly.Also i don t understand how you can criticise Rooneys attitude, anyone who knows anything about him knows he is more passionate about football than the bottom half of the Premiership put together and his desire to play well not just for himself but for the team and hes fans. Last season they ahd to actually tell him not to train as ahrd because they thoguht he was training to hard and would tire himself out for the actual gamesAlso i don t feel Rio is over-ratedas he is a world class defender and there is little he can t do defensivly or other players he can t cope with. and besides it is not like he is the one over-rating himself if you think he is over-rated in teh first place, it is all papers, pundits etc

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Crop Circle?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2680
Crop circles are areas of cereal or similar crops that have been systematically flattened to form various geometric patterns. The phenomenon itself only entered the public imagination in its current form after the notable appearances in England in the late 1970s. People who study crop circle phenomena sometimes humorously call themselves cerealogists , after the usually known name for the pseudoscience that studies crop circles: cereology. Cerealogists call these designs agriglyphs.In an unrelated phenomenon, fungal circles formed by a spreading mycelium are familiar, though on a much smaller scale. Older, larger fungal circles are not recognized when they have broken into arcs or patches. In Scandinavia and in Britain, the phenomenon of mushrooms or puffballs forming circles in a patch of meadow or pasture was referred to in folklore as ??lvringar, pixie circles or elf circles, and was attributed by countryfolk to mystical forces. This phenomenon is both commonplace and much smaller in scale, however, and is recognized[1]as the natural growth of fungus colonies.

God springs forth from the primitive limbic system of your brain, the last remnants of your reptillion past. The area where our raw emotions reside, including the irrational belief systems. The religious experience is triggered by deep depression, starvation, near death, or other highly charged situations. The born-again christian phenomena has a scientific basis....yes, your limbic system. Why has man evolved this mechanism you might ask? Simple...it was a survival mechanism of our cave man ancestors to cope with a hostile and unknown universe. The cerebral cortex is a more recent development. Here is where our rational and logical thought processes take place. It is here that the atheists have found their basis in reality. In reality, there is no sentient, omnipresent, omnipotent supernatural being or force....therefore all the inequities and misery of the world will always persist, no matter how hard some try to get that limbic brainof ours to work...sorry

In a milder definition of God, I would describe him as :G for Generator (Creator)O for Operator   (Who runs the show, the director)D for Destructor (Who has power to destroy evils)The soul that can create, perserve through operations and destroy when the time comes is the God.the one who creates, operates and destroys is the GodIn a super fine definition I would like to describe the God as :God the one and the only witness of the entire creation and beyond,knowledgable of all and has all the wisdom,the world runs as per his desiresthough he does not have to use his own energy or rather power to run the world or make changes to the shows being played on this world stage,his will itself is enough for thatis the Godthe one and the only, the utlimate truth that is imperishable, eternal and devoid of any changes or free from the effect of time and free from any possibility of adultration and free from getting staleis the GodThe God is eternal, The god is beyond the discussion of being with forms or formless, the God is the unthinkableall powerful, full of happiness and the source of happiness,eternal, unthinkable, unchangeable, ever fresh with joy, full of consciousness that can only describe the god, in front of him any other lifeform s consciousness looks primitive or tiny or dwarfhe is full of goodness, most of his goodness many don t even understand... yes words are limited to express what or who the God isBut that is the GodIt may be said that the God runs this world as per his divine law of justice and through his will which is the Divine will of the GodWorld s stage show is only a fraction of his divine show that is being played over here.  In fact the one that exists is the GodSince God exists so do we existbut our existence is dependent on the God and definitly not the other way arounda simple logical deduction from the above statements is :No matter how much any mortal or a living being expands his consciousness, he will only be a dwarf in front of the Great, the God, the Lord himselfGod comes down at least 10 times to the earth though never with his full force since he loves all earthlingsGod comes down only as a substratum, a fratction and plays incognito with us.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Marfan Syndrome?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 434
Marfan SyndromeWhat is the Marfan syndrome?The Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder. Connective tissue provides substance and support to tendons, ligaments, blood vessel walls, cartilage, heart valves and many other structures. In the Marfan syndrome, the chemical makeup of the connective tissue isn t normal. As a result, many of these structures aren t as stiff as they should be.The Marfan syndrome is inherited and affects many parts of the body. There s no single conclusive test for diagnosing it, but people who have it often have many similar traits. Besides perhaps having heart problems, people with the Marfan syndrome are often tall and thin. They also may have slender, tapering fingers, long arms and legs, curvature of the spine and eye problems. Sometimes the Marfan syndrome is so mild that few (if any) symptoms exist. In the most severe cases, which are rare, life-threatening problems may occur at any age.What are the blood vessel problems?In the Marfan syndrome, the walls of the major arteries are weakened. The aorta, the major artery that leaves the heart, often is affected. When this occurs, it gets bigger (dilates), which can weaken the inner aortic wall. Under strenuous exertion, the aorta wall can tear. Blood can leak through these tears into the aortic wall, separating its layers ??? a process called aortic dissection. Another problem that may occur if the aortic wall weakens is that an aneurysm (AN u-rizm) may form.What are the cardiac valve problems?The Marfan syndrome can involve any of the four heart valves. The two most important ones, however, are the mitral and aortic valves. Blood may leak backward through a valve, increasing the heart s workload. As a result, over time the heart may enlarge. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common but usually less significant valve problem. People without the Marfan syndrome can have mitral valve prolapse, but those with the Marfan syndrome often have an oversized mitral valve. As it closes, the valve billows (prolapses) back into the left atrium. This causes abnormal heart sounds, which a doctor can hear with a stethoscope.How do you treat the Marfan syndrome?Once the Marfan syndrome has been diagnosed, regular visits with a cardiologist are needed. Chest X-rays and Doppler echo tests are usually performed. Other tests also may be necessary.Different people may need different types of treatment. Some people may not need treatment, but others may need drugs that lower heart rate, blood pressure or both. When the aorta or aortic valve develop major problems, surgery is usually advised.People with the Marfan syndrome who have an abnormal heart or who ve had heart surgery for their Marfan syndrome risk developing an infection of the heart wall or heart valve (endocarditis). This happens when bacteria enter the bloodstream. The American Heart Association no longer recommends taking routine antibiotics before certain dental procedures except for people at highest risk for bad outcomes if they develop endocarditis. This includes people with a prosthetic heart valve, people who have previously had endocarditis, people with certain types of congenital heart disease, and people with a heart transplant who develop a problem with a heart valve.   The AHA no longer recommends routine antibiotics solely to prevent endocarditis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures .
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1972
Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder of the connective tissue that causes abnormalities of the patient s eyes, cardiovascular system, and musculoskeletal system. Marfan syndrome is one of the more common inheritable disorders.Marfan syndrome affects three major organ systems of the body: the heart and circulatory system, the bones and muscles, and the eyes. The genetic mutation responsible for TreatmentMarfan was discovered in 1991. It affects the body s production of fibrillin, which is a protein that is an important part of connective tissue. Fibrillin is the primary component of the microfibrils that allow tissues to stretch repeatedly without weakening. Because the patient s fibrillin is abnormal, his or her connective tissues are looser than usual, which weakens or damages the support structures of the entire body.The most common external signs associated with Marfan syndrome include excessively long arms and legs, with the patient s arm span being greater than his or her height. The fingers and toes may be long and slender, with loose joints that can be bent beyond their normal limits. This unusual flexibility is called hypermobility. The patient s face may also be long and narrow, and he or she may have a noticeable curvature of the spine. It is important to note, however, that Marfan patients vary widely in the external signs of their disorder and in their severity; even two patients from the same family may look quite different. Most of the external features of Marfan syndrome become more pronounced as the patient gets older, so that diagnosis of the disorder is often easier in adults than in children. In many cases, the patient may have few or very minor outward signs of the disorder, and the diagnosis may be missed until the patient develops vision problems or cardiac symptoms.Causes and symptomsMarfan syndrome is caused by a single gene for fibrillin on chromosome 15, which is inherited in most cases from an affected parent. Between 15 and 25% of cases result from spontaneous mutations. Mutations of the fibrillin gene (FBNI) are unique to each family affected by Marfan, which makes rapid genetic diagnosis impossible, given present technology. The syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that someone who has it has a 50% chance of passing it on to any offspring.TreatmentThe treatment and management of Marfan is tailored to the specific symptoms of each patient. Some patients find that the syndrome has little impact on their overall lifestyle; others have found their lives centered on the disorder.-

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is Mastoditis?
QUESTION CONTENT: My son has been diagnosed with this. please give imput. thank u
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2993
Mastoiditis is a bacterial infection in the mastoid process, the prominent bone behind the ear. This disorder usually occurs when untreated or inadequately treated acute otitis media spreads from the middle ear into the surrounding bone???the mastoid process.Usually, symptoms appear 2 or more weeks after acute otitis media develops, as the spreading infection destroys the inner part of the mastoid process. A collection of pus (abscess) may form in the bone. The skin covering the mastoid process may become red, swollen, and tender, and the external ear is pushed sideways and down. Other symptoms are fever, pain around and within the ear, and a creamy, profuse discharge from the ear. The pain tends to be persistent and throbbing. Hearing loss is progressive.Computed tomography (CT) shows that the air cells (spaces in bone that normally contain air) in the mastoid process are filled with fluid. As mastoiditis progresses, the spaces enlarge. Inadequately treated mastoiditis can result in deafness, blood poisoning (sepsis), infection of the tissues covering the brain (meningitis), brain abscess, or death.Treatment is with intravenous antibiotics. A sample of ear discharge is examined to identify the organism causing the infection and to determine the antibiotics most likely to eliminate the bacteria. Antibiotics may be given by mouth once the person starts to recover and are continued for at least 2 weeks. If an abscess has formed in the bone, surgical drainage (mastoidectomy) is required.Licenced pramedic

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1197
The problem is listening to the wrong voice. This voice which tells you that you do not equal up to that which is good and right and offers no way out is not of truth. The being which is the epitome of evil is one in which mans eyes can not see yet this being exists and has greatly influenced mans history greatly. Its name is Satan.Ephesians 6: 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.But there is one that is of truth and he is the author of Love.Find him and he will choose you.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1198
I ve seen people very unhappy because they love the wrong thing or person, and I ve seen people very content in their hatred.  Loving an abusive relationship, circumstance, or substance will not make you happy.Hate can be a reasonable and healthy response to a bad situation.  Used properly, it motivates one to change their circumstances, and improve their lives aka become happy.Both love and hate can ruin happiness if either is experienced to the point of obsession or total absence.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 959
If a person opposes even the possibility of there being a God, then any evidence can be rationalized or explained away. It is like if someone refuses to believe that people have walked on the moon, then no amount of information is going to change their thinking. Photographs of astronautswalking on the moon, interviews with the astronauts, moon rocks...all the evidence would be worthless, because the person has already concluded that people cannot go to the moon. When it comes to the possibility of God s existence, the Bible says that there are people who have seen sufficient evidence, but they have suppressed the truth about God.1 On the other hand, for those who want to know God if He is there, He says, You will seek me and find me; when you seek me with all your heart, I will be found by you. 2 Before you look at the facts surrounding God s existence, ask yourself, If God does exist, would I want to know Him?

Fuzzy Zoeller is a wise-crackin cracker old timer.  Tiger Woods was just coming on the golf scene and he made an insensitive comment regarding Tigers ethnicity.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 211
He was a professional golfer...he was not discrimanted against but he made a wisecrack ,once, about Tiger Woods and fried chicken that did not go over well at the time
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2465
Fuzzy made a comment at The Masters golf tournament when Tiger was many strokes ahead of the rest of the players.  This was the year that Tiger won by 12 strokes or so, and set many scoring records. On Saturday, when leaving the course, Fuzzy was asked what he thought about Tiger s amazing play.  His response went something like - Well, he s hitting it well, and putting it well.  Just tell him not to serve Fried Chicken next year... (he then started walking away, stopped and continued ) or collared greens or whatever it is they eat A couple of things to understand this comment - 1.  Winners of the Masters choose the Champions dinner the following year.  Tiger was obviously going to win, so he would be able to choose the dinner.2.  Fuzzy Zoeller is a notorious prankster/jokester, and in my opinion he didn t mean anything harmful by it.  He had just landed several big endorsement contracts at that time, and he lost every single one of them because of the outcry over his statement.  Although incrediby insensitive, rude, and racist - I believe he was just trying to be funny.

QUESTION CONTENT: In Book 6, when Harry and Dumbledore get the Horcrux, and the note is inside it, who is RAB?Is it Sirius brother, Regalus
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2627
I agree, I think it s Regulus, Sirius brother. He was a Death Eater, and Voldemort murdered him, so maybe because of the Horcrux. Another interesting note is that in the early chapters of Book 5, Harry and the gang found a locket that could not be opened in Grimmauld Place when cleaning up the house. Could it be the locket that contained the Horcrux, taken by Regulus?

I would bet as much.It seems a little late to introduce another RAB in book 7. Also, she made a note of mentioning him in HP&HBP.

Sirius brother, Regulus A. Black without a doubt. Aas far as I can remember, he was killed because he showed resistance against Voldemort. I could be wrong about that.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 742
I agree with the other answers.  There is a paragraph in HBP near the beginning (if my memory serves me correctly) that mentions Regulus dying only a few days after deflecting from the Death Eaters.  Something I also found interesting is that JK makes it a point to show Mundungus Fletcher dropping something from the Black collection that he apparently stole.  Makes me wonder if the goblet or whatever it was he stole could contain the horcrux.  Why else would she put that part in?  I dont trust Mundungus.

I would think it s Regalus, but it s J.K. Rowling...  It s probably someone we d never guess, or someone new.

The Nazi rise to power brought an end to the Weimar Republic, a parliamentary democracy established in Germany after World War I. Following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor on January 30, 1933, the Nazi state (also referred to as the Third Reich) quickly became a regime in which Germans enjoyed no guaranteed basic rights. After a suspicious fire in the Reichstag (the German Parliament), on February 28, 1933, the government issued a decree which suspended constitutional civil rights and created a state of emergency in which official decrees could be enacted without parliamentary confirmation.Benito Mussolini BENITO MUSSOLINI, (1883-1945), Fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. He centralized all power in himself as the leader (il duce) of the Fascist party and attempted to create an Italian empire, ultimately in alliance with HITLER s Germany. The defeat of Italian arms in WORLD WAR II brought an end to his imperial dream and led to his downfall.

QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3013
This topic will help you out:What is a Nuclear Stress test?A nuclear stress test is a non-invasive procedure that your doctor will use to determine if you have coronary artery disease (CAD). You will be injected with Thallium, a radioactive material, and the camera detects the rays from the Thallium because it is absorbed differently in healthy and damaged tissue. The nuclear test is preferable because it results in a better image because of the color difference.How is a Nuclear Stress test done?There are many blockages can t be determined until a stress test is done. In a nuclear stress test you are injected with radioactive material Thallium, once at rest and once during exercise. After each injection pictures are taken of the heart to determine if there are any blockages or defects. The heart s activity is also monitored by an EKG at rest and during exertion. Your doctor may do this procedure in a slightly different order.Why is a nuclear stress test given?A nuclear stress test is used for patients with    * Atypical chest pain    * Left bundle branch block - impulses are slowed or blocked in the left bundle branch of the heart.    * Serious multi-vessel disease suspected    * Undergoing preoperative clearance for non cardiacsurgery    * Unable to exercise, therefore at a high risk for CAD What does a nuclear stress test show?A nuclear stress test shows:    * The extent of the artery blockage    * The effectiveness of a cardiac procedure    * The level of exercise a patient can tolerate    * The prognosis of MI (heart attack) patients    * The cause of chest pain What do the test results mean?    * If both the rest and exercise pictures are normal then there is no blockage.    * If the rest picture is normal but the exercise picture is not then there is a blockage    * If both are abnormal then there is damage to the heart.    * Chest pain and shortness of breath can be indications of blockages in the coronary arteries. How do I know if I can take a nuclear stress test?You cannot have a nuclear stress test if you have:    * A pulmonary infection    * Coaction of the aorta - a constricted segment of the aorta that blocks blood flow    * Heart failure    * You are pregnant How do I know if I have a poor prognosis?There is a poor prognosis if there are    * Multiple reversible or nonreversible effects    * Reverse dilation    * Increased lung uptake of imaging agent more than 50%.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 41
Thallium scanning is a test to estimate the amount of blood reaching the heart muscle during rest and exercise. It is typically done to determine the cause of unexplained chest pain or to determine the location and amount of injured heart muscle after a heart attack.  It shows how well blood flows to the heart muscle. It s usually done along with an exercise stress test on a treadmill or bicycle.The thallium stress test is useful to determine the following:Extent of a coronary artery blockagePrognosis of patients who ve suffered a heart attackEffectiveness of cardiac procedures done to improve circulation in coronary arteriesCause(s) of chest painLevel of exercise that a patient can safely performClick these links if you would like for more info:http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4743http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/tc/Cardiac-Rehabilitation-Exams-and-Testshttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nuclear-stress-test/AN00168

You have got very detailed reply above. It is less expensive in comparisonwith angiogram. It is non invasive. But, if you have to undergo bypass, angiogram will be a must. This is available only with bigger hospitals unlike angiogram test. There is one more test known as 3 dimensional cardio cartography test which gives detailed physiological report of the heart. It is still less expensive than stress thallium. Aurveda has got very good medicines for coronary artery disease. There are medicines which can avoid bypass pr angiplasty or stent surgeries.

God is the need for many people,Like me, to feel that life works out in some appropriate way, Somehow, that I will never understand, but need to know, By way of faith! So Faith is a form of knowing, But it is a form of knowing about that Which we can not prove,Or claim to have ownership over. Faith is knowing by way of transformation, Like the need to know, transforms into Knowing.What do we know, we know that life works out, Makes sense and is alive, In the children and their warmest smiles.

aisvaryasya samagrasya viryasya yasasah sriyah jnana-vairagyayos caiva sannam bhaga itingana (Visnu Purana 6.5.47)Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is thus defined by Parasara Muni as one who is full in six opulences???who has full strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation.Lord Krishna declared in Bhagavad Gita AS It Is. I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.  This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.  Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.  Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.  Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.  But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors, the healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the offering.  I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable om. I am also the Rg, the Sama, and the Yajur [Vedas].  I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.

QUESTION CONTENT: It s related to the history of Pakistan; a part of Asain subcontinent
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2621
Lucknow Pact refers to an agreement between Indian National Congress and Muslim League. In 1916, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, a member of the Indian National Congress, negotiated with the Muslim League to reach an agreement to pressurise British Government to have a more liberal approach to India and give Indians more authority to run their country. This was a considerable change of policy for Muslim League as it was established to preserve Muslim interests in India, and for this, they needed to be supportive of British rule in India. After the unpopular partition of Bengal, Muslim League was confused about its stand and it was this time that Jinnah approached League. Jinnah was the mastermind and architect of the pact. Even though Jinnah was a member of Indian National Congress then, he later went to become the leader of Muslim League.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2687
 Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (c. 1398 ??? c. February 3, 1468) was a German metal-worker and inventor who achieved fame for his contributions to the technology of printing during 1448, including a type metal alloy and oil-based inks, a mould for casting type accurately, and a new kind of printing press based on presses already in use for book-binding. Tradition credits him with inventing movable type in Europe -- an improvement on the block printing already in use there. By combining these elements into a production system, he allowed for the rapid printing of written materials, and an information explosion in Renaissance Europe.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Time?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1111
Hmnn.......each one of them gave different answers.....The concept of time is self-evident. An hour consists of a certain number of minutes, a day of hours and a year of days. But we rarely think about the fundamental nature of time.One way to answer the question What is time? is to declare that it is what accurate clocks measure.  This is correct, but it doesn t tell us enough.  We want something deeper. The most popular deep answer to the question What is physical time? is that it is a special system of relations among instantaneous events.  It is what underlies our temporal claims that Newton lived before Einstein and at the same time as Leibniz yet a lot longer than anyone who died as a teenager. (The relations are in italics although the events in this example are not instantaneous; but longer events are considered to be composed of instantaneous events.)  This is the answer offered by Adolf Gr??nbaum who applies the contemporary mathematical theory of continuity to physical processes.  How do we tell whether this is the correct answer to our question?  To be convinced, we need to be told what the relevant terms mean, such as certain system of relations. In addition, we need to be presented with a theory of time implying that time is this system of relations; and we need to be shown how that theory adequately addresses the many features that are required for a successful theory of time.  Finally, we need to compare this theory to its alternatives.  This article won t carry out these tasks.A different, but popular answer to the question What is time? is that time is the form of becoming.  To assess this answer, which is from Alfred North Whitehead, we need to be told what the term form of becoming means; we need to be presented with a detailed theory of time implying that time is the form of becoming; and we need to investigate how it addresses those many features required for a successful theory of time.  A third theory of time is Michael Dummett s constructive model of time; he argues that time is a composition of intervals rather than of durationless instants.  The model is constructive in the sense that there do not exist any times which aren t detectable in principle by a physical process.

Time is an alternative way to measure distance. A day, one revolution of the Earth. A year, one cyle around the sun.  This is a couple of ways of measuring the distance we travel. It is related as the ratio of distance to rate (a smaller measure of distance). In mathematics, rate is referred to as the differential with respect to time or dt. Thus distance may be expressed as the product of time and its differential. (D=T[dt]). Distance as measured in time.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2476
Time is something that has been there all the time.There was probably a time when no one cared what time of day or night it was. Then somehwere along the line human beings discovered the idea of using time as measurement toool to regulate their life and other activities.Plants and animals have body clocks that keeps them motivated to find ways and means to survive.Although we have created various units of measurements of time from fraction of a second to terms like light years yet we do not know - neither the begining nor the end of time.That s why the philosophers use terms like time immemorial.Time is indeed an unfathomable dimension.Although its units are the same its value and worth is very different for different people.As the earth slows down significantly, would that change the definition of time, which is also based on the vibration frequency of a certain element (cesium ) particle.All the historical facts of past, present and future are human attempts to capture time. But this is onething that is beyond human reach even with the most imaginative time machines - this is one of natures way of healing the wounds and provide rays of hope at the same time.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 288
an imaginary friend for grown-ups.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 600
God is the origin of all life and all power. He is LOVE and a part of his Love is Justice and Purity. His holy spirit are the eternal laws in creation and this laws are interwoven in everything.As humans we have free will and we can decide to follow our deep intuitive perception, so our conscience or to follow just intellectual reasons. Our intuition lets us know what God`s will is and we can listen to GOD`s guidance if we listen to our conscience. The laws in Creation which we see in nature are also applicaple for our spiritual inner life. So same attracts same. If we develop hate we also attract hate. If we develop love we attract love. On this earth people from all attitutes live together. This is different in the beyond, where the law of gravity makes sure that only similar will meet on the sphere of similar gravity. There is also this law of that what we sow we will reap. It also applies to our spirit and also earthly well-being, as our will is able to form our surrounding, if we want that or not. So GOD does not personally occupy himself with all the small and little problems we have, as it is not necessary. The divine laws will without doubt always bring us back what we sow and our current existance is a mirror to our own attitute. Knowing that we can use this for our advantage and in that also for our neighbours advantage.God in his love seperated part of him and incarnated into the body of a man named Jesus, to bring to humankind knowledge about how God`s will is, and about his eternal laws and the meaning of our life.  Unfortunately men took the simple words of Jesus and cramped and distorted much of them in making a religion and several churches around it, telling people that they only come to heaven when they join this or that church. This is bushit as every person stands for himself and does not need a church to be connected to the heavens. The key for that lies in his free will and in the two major laws God gave to us. First: Love your God with your heart, your mind, your soul, and your strength. Second: To love your neighbor as yourself.Everything coming from GOD is connected with his love.We are surrounded with love. If we open up for the good, if we want to understand, if we need help, this help is always there, for everyone.  We should just listen more to our intuition instead only to our brain (so let your intuition be the guide and the brain your servant, not the other way round)  , then it would be easier for so many people to access this help.

THIS BRINGS TO MIND A FAMOUS QUOTE: WHAT IS MAN THAT YOU SHOULD ARE MINDFUL OF HIM, OR THE SON OF MAN THAT YOU SHOULD VISIT HIM. Psalms 8What is the greatest problem facing men today? It is the same problem that faces the church and men s ministries.As a whole, the church is not making disciples. We have a great problem in the church today. An executive in a major denomination said one day, Our churches are not making disciples. But that s not the real problem. The real problem is - we think we are. So what?Most men only know enough about God to be disappointed with him. They listen to the sermons, they try to do the right things, they have it in their hearts to be faithful Christians, but they don t have much joy, and certainly lack victory over sinful habits. They feel a sense of shame. That s because they have never actually been educated about what it means to be Christian. They are not disciples.What does a man need to know, think, and do to be a disciple, or follower, of Jesus Christ? Psalm 8, the favorite passage of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., suggests three things a man needs to know to be a disciple:1. To know the God who created man, 2. To know who God created man to be, and 3. To know what God created man to do. These, then, are also three tasks for a man who wants to make disciples.The order is very important. I believe that too often we teach men what they are created to do before they actually understand who God created them to be. In other words, we put them to work but don t adequately tell them who they are in Christ.Or, if we do tell them who God created them to be, we sometimes leave it there. Then they fall on a hard time, but they don t understand thefaithful character of the God who created them, and they wither in the heat of the moment.Instead, the first task of making disciples is to help men understand something of the character of the God who is. TO KNOW THE GOD WHO CREATED MANPsalm 8 (which I ve paraphrased throughout this article) begins, O Jehovah (self-existent, eternal), our Adonai (sovereign), how excellent is your reputation, your good name, among all of us here on earth! You have painted your glory on the canvas of the deep space we see in the evening sky. When I contemplate the cosmos, the earth must seem to you like a pebble in the palm of your hand. When I ponder the work of your fingers, the moon and stars which punctuate an evening sky that would otherwise be dark, desolate, and foreboding, a moon and stars which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him? Before a man, a creature, can truly understand who he is created to be or what he is created to do, he must first understand something of his Creator. Who is our Creator God? How much does he know? Does he care? Can he do anything about it? How good is he? What is he like?Psalm 8 speaks of the work of your fingers. It was finger work for God to create the moon and stars - not the back-breaking work of felling a forest, but like snapping a pencil between his fingers. Psalm 8 continues, which you have set in place. He dipped his hand into a bowl of liquid light, then flicked his fingers against the curtain of the night sky. We could go on endlessly, but here is a sample of his greatness: He is sovereign, holy, awesome, gracious, loving, merciful, faithful, patient, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, infinite, eternal, invisible, immutable, the only wise God, transcendent, immanent, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the CEO of CEOs, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, the God who was, the God who is, the God who is to come, the alpha and omega, the door, the gate, the bread of life, the living water, the Good Shepherd, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, the soon and coming King, the LORD - just to mention a few. TO KNOW WHO GOD CREATED MAN TO BE Once we plumb the depths, or should I say, begin to plumb the depths of the character and attributes of the eternal, self-existent God, we can make progress to discover who he created us to be. The Psalmist continues, What is man that you are even aware of him, the son of man that you actually care for his well being? He made you just a little lower than the angels themselves, and crowned you-yes you!-with glory and honor. Now we can begin to understand our own splendor, our dignity, as creatures. Such a great God would only create a magnificent creature, especially one upon whom he literally stamps the image of God. Maybe your dad told you that you were stupid, that you would never amount to anything. Maybe you ve been trying to prove him right, or wrong. Maybe your father made his approval conditional to your performance in sports, schools, chores, and so forth. As one man told me, No matter what I did I could never please my dad. But God thinks you are absolutely super! He loves you, man! He made us-you, a little lower than the angels themselves, and crowned you-yes you!-with glory and honor. In other words, you are God s most excellent creation. You are God s crowning achievement. You are the full expression of God s creative genius! Yes, yes, yes. God was at his very best when he made you! TO KNOW WHAT GOD CREATED MAN TO DO It gets better. Now, finally, when you, or your disciple, understands who God is and who God created you to be, you are ready to probe what God created man to do.

I live in Fiji Islands,where Rugby is a big sport. One of the most fascinating things about the sport here is ( from my perspective that is ),how much religion ,God ,is involved in the sport. Some time ago Fiji was on the a long losing stretch with the other international teams. Then someone decided that Hey,Lets put a bible verse on the players t-shirt, then they will win for sure . For sure Psalm3:16 appeared planted in the center,sponsors logos pushed aside and Fiji was once again winning again. But after sometime then God grew tired of Fiji ,abandoned it for some other poor team. The logos have disappeared now replaced by sponsor logos of local bread/wheat manufacturers who are content with putting Nike boots on the winning try score player .Before every game though,the players would hurdle ,and pray with great vigor Pliz Jezzu(Jesus) ,help us to win,help my country to win, put power into me blah blah . The game is on.Now if they win , Its praise be Jezzu, First of all I would like thank Jezzu,without whose help we would not have won, uhh ...next i would to thank ..... ,all the while the other team hurdles together for the coach to scold them. Now if Fiji had lost its Oooo...well our boyz played well....the other team was better .....blah blah ,no mention of God,Jezzu. Just a quiet hurdle, mumbled prayer and disband before the cameras can get a view of the clouded,tearful eyed disbelief that THEIR God had forsaken them for another team,well God works in mysterious ways huh.It then makes me wonder on a quote i read somewhere, which i think said ,that man s greatest invention or was it excuse is God.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is I ?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2603
I is way that we refer to the self in language.  But the question of what is I goes deeper.For example, self may be an illusion -- an arbitrary concept that we impose on the brain to suceed in certain social environments.  It may not be a antecedent to metaphysics the way that Decartes suggested.In several Eastern philosophies, overcoming the illusory notion of self is the first step to seeing the true face of reality.  In such a context, I is a barrier to actual understanding... it promotes separateness because I is contained and not necessarily connected to the totality of society or nature.So to answer your question, it is mostly a function of what perspective you ascribe to.  I can be as plain as the most basic form of self-reference, or it may be as interesting as the fundamental barrier that prevents human consciousness from connecting to greater reality.

Hitler was a corporal in the German Army during World War One. After the war, he tried to become a painter but got no recognition as an artist. He became depressed and blamed all his problems on the jews. That got him recognition, so he ran for public office and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He made himself F??hrer (dictator) and the rest is history. He committed suicide in his bunker in Berlin in 1945 as the Red Army was closing in.Hitler was nothis real name. It was Shickelgrubber.

God controls everything beyond my control.  This is from my perspective. God changes (becomes less) as I get older and gain more independence from my parental control.   When I start to remove myself from societies control, God becomes even less.  When I live on a boat in the sea, outside of any Government s control God becomes even less.  When I am on an island, in the middle of an ocean which belongs to no-one, I am dependent totally on the weather, the food the sea and the land provides, and the rain from the sky to produce my living. God therefore controls what food is on the island initially.  As I learn to cultivate the land on the island, and breed the animals on the island for food, God becomes less.When on this island, I ask God for help what is it that I would need God s help for?I have plentiful food, sunshine, fresh water, and entertainment.  If God is a man as you suggest, and I am a man living on this island, what is his purpose? Let us suppose that I do not get lonely as I am used to being alone.  Let us suppose that I know how to cook, and I know how to tie my own shoelaces.  Do I need to open a hospital on the island? Do I need a fire brigade? Do I need a policeman? Do I need an ambulance?  Do I need a local council to tax me? Does money have any concept whatsoever?What is it that I would need a God for?When God leaves you on that island for life, and lets you die there alone.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is Fifth Disease?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1011
What is fifth disease? Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a slapped-cheek rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a cold a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.What causes fifth disease?Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against parvovirus, but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot catch parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.Can adults get fifth disease?Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.Is fifth disease contagious?Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic slapped cheek rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to just have a cold. The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.How is fifth disease diagnosed?A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.Is fifth disease serious?Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.Parvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious illness in persons with sickle-cell disease or similar types of chronic anemia. In such persons, parvovirus B19 can cause an acute, severe anemia. The ill person may be pale, weak, and tired, and should see his or her physician for treatment. (The typical rash of fifth disease is rarely seen in these persons.) Once the infection is controlled, the anemia resolves. Furthermore, persons who have problems with their immune systems may also develop a chronic anemia with parvovirus B19 infection that requires medical treatment. People who have leukemia or cancer, who are born with immune deficiencies, who have received an organ transplant, or who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at risk for serious illness due to parvovirus B19 infection.Occasionally, serious complications may develop from parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy. For details, please see the CDC information sheet entitled, Parvovirus B19 Infection and Pregnancy. How are parvovirus B19 infections treated?Treatment of symptoms such as fever, pain, or itching is usually all that is needed for fifth disease. Adults with joint pain and swelling may need to rest, restrict their activities, and take medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen to relieve symptoms. The few people who have severe anemia caused by parvovirus B19 infection may need to be hospitalized and receive blood transfusions. Persons with immune problems may need special medical care, including treatment with immune globulin (antibodies), to help their bodies get rid of the infection.Can parvovirus B19 infection be prevented?There is no vaccine or medicine that prevents parvovirus B19 infection. Frequent handwashing is recommended as a practical and probably effective method to decrease the chance of becoming infected. Excluding persons with fifth disease from work, child care centers, or schools is not likely to prevent the spread of the virus, since people are contagious before they develop the rash.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Humpty Dumpty?
QUESTION CONTENT: My mother didn t know he was an egg, but is he??
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 1551
Previous to the short, clumsy person meaning, humpty dumpty referred to a drink of brandy boiled with ale. There are also various theories of an original Humpty Dumpty , who was not an egg. Most, if not all, of these must be classified as false etymologies.According to an insert taken from the East Anglia Tourist Board in England, Humpty Dumpty was a powerful cannon used in the Siege of Colchester during the English Civil War. It was mounted on top of the St Mary s at the Wall Church in Colchester defending the city against siege in the summer of 1648. Although Colchester was a Royalist stronghold, it was besieged by the Roundheads for 11 weeks before finally falling. The church tower was hit by enemy cannon fire and the top of the tower was blown off, sending Humpty tumbling to the ground. Naturally all the King s horses and all the King s men (Royalist cavalry and infantry respectively) tried to mend him but in vain. Other reports have Humpty Dumpty referring to a sniper nicknamed One-Eyed Thompson, who occupied the same church tower. Visitors to Colchester can see the reconstructed Church tower as they reach the top of Balkerne Hill on the left hand side of the road. An extended version of the rhyme gives additional verses, including the following: In Sixteen Hundred and Forty-Eight When England suffered the pains of state The Roundheads lay siege to Colchester town Where the King s men still fought for the crown There One-Eyed Thompson stood on the wall A gunner of deadliest aim of all From St. Mary s Tower his cannon he fired Humpty-Dumpty was its name... In another theory, Humpty Dumpty referred to King Richard III of England, the hunchbacked monarch, the Wall being either the name of his horse (called White Surrey in Shakespeare s play), or a reference to the supporters who deserted him. During the battle of Bosworth Field, he fell off his steed and was said to have been hacked into pieces . (However, although the play depicts Richard as a hunchback, other historical evidence suggests that he was not.) The story of Cardinal Wolsey s downfall is supposedly depicted in the children s nursery rhyme of Humpty Dumpty. At length Cawood Castle (Cawood, a village in Yorkshire, seven miles southwest of York) passed to Cardinal Wolsey, who let it fall into disrepair in the early part of his career (1514 ??? 1530), due to his residence at the Court, devotion to temporal affairs and his neglect of his diocesan duties. King Henry VIII sent Wolsey back home in 1523 after he failed to obtain a divorce from the Pope ??? a huge mistake on Wolsey???s part. Wolsey returned to the castle and began to restore it to its former grandeur. However, he was arrested for high treason in November, 1530 and ordered to London for trial. He left on 6 November, but took ill at Leicester and died in the Abbey there on 29 November. An explanation given on a British radio programme described Humpty Dumpty as a siege tower, used by the Cavaliers (King s Men) during the English civil war. Unfortunately, as it was poorly designed, the tower often toppled over when it was full of men and broke. Hence, All the King s horses and all the King s men, couldn t put Humpty together again.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is RSV?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2734
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes an illness that usually resembles a moderate to severe cold and is very contagious. RSV most often resolves on its own and does not cause major health concerns. This infection can become a problem when it is severe or leads to complications. Babies (especially those born prematurely), people with immune system problems, people with heart or lung problems, and older adults have an increased risk of developing complications from RSV infection.Outbreaks of RSV infection generally occur at regular and predictable times each year, although they vary in severity. The number of infections usually peaks in the late fall, winter, and early spring in the United States and Europe. In tropical climates, epidemics occur during the rainy season. What causes infection with RSV?RSV infection is caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory tract???the nose, eyes, throat, and lungs. Infection spreads from person to person through everyday contact. The virus is most often spread by sharing food or drink with an infected person or by getting droplets containing the virus on your hands and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. The incubation period???the time from exposure to RSV until you develop symptoms???ranges from 2 to 8 days, but usually is 4 to 6 days.There are two types of RSV, as well as multiple subtypes (strains). Therefore, the body does not develop complete immunity to the virus, and infection can occur repeatedly throughout life, sometimes even during the same season.

Hello, fellow Mariner! At the beginning of the season I was a little annoyed with Jose Vidro. Signing him to me was a mistake, because of obvious injury risks (even being a DH). And he used to constantly foul balls off when Ichiro had second... I also believe he ended Ichiro s stolen base streak on a failed hit&run.. But I m over it, he s really stepped up and proved himself. Ich has other records to snap like Consecutive 200 hit seasons and all star games! Right now I d say its a tie between big sexy and rick freakin white... Come on!! Kenny Lofton!?!?! Pitch to em!!! Argh. And Sexson? Jesus don t even get me started. He ll need to hit .225 before I begin to think to reconsider. Now if the question was Who do you hate the most associated with your favorite team? Bill Bavasi. That idiot pulled back Richie Sexson!!!!! We could ve dumped his $14 mil and gotten someone decent in the off season.. I d take Livan, wouldn t you?

His most famous works, Histories and Annals, exist in fragmentary form, though many of his earlier writings were lost to time. Tacitus is known for being generally reliable (if somewhat biased toward what he saw as Roman immorality) and for having a uniquely direct (if not blunt) writing style.Tacitus (Marcus Claudius Tacitus) (t??s ??t??s), d. 276, Roman emperor (275???76). An elderly senator with a reputation for honesty and vigor, he was chosen by the senate to succeed the murdered Aurelian. He failed to restore the glory of the senate, and after reigning only a few months he died when on campaign in Asia. He was almost certainly murdered. Probus succeeded him.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Geocaching?  If you know before Googling it how many caches do you have?
QUESTION CONTENT: 86 for the Peanut Gallery.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3031
Geocaching is an entertaining adventure game for gps users. Participating in a cache hunt is a good way to take advantage of the wonderful features and capability of a gps unit. The basic idea is to have individuals and organizations set up caches all over the world and share the locations of these caches on the internet. GPS users can then use the posted longitude and latitude location coordinates to find the caches. Once found, a cache may provide the visitor with a wide variety of rewards, treasures, trinkets, etc. All the visitor is asked to do is if they get something they should try to leave something for the cache.There is currently over 200,000 geocaches world-wide.I personally have not placed any caches yet, but I have found just over 100 caches so far.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 745
Geocaching is an outdoor activity that most often involves the use of a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receiver or traditional navigational techniques to find a geocache (or cache ) placed anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small, waterproof container containing a logbook and treasure , usually trinkets of little value. Participants are called geocachers; those not familiar with geocaching are called geo-muggles or just muggles, a term borrowed from the Harry Potter series.Geocaching is similar to a much older activity called letterboxing. The major difference is its use of the GPS and the Internet.There are a number of Web sites that list geocache sites around the world. The best known is geocaching.com, which dates from 2000 and whose owners have attempted to commercialize the sport, including attempts to trademark the word geocache . These attempts have often proved controversial in the community.In the United States, where most geocaching services are hosted, co-ordinates are not protected by copyright but cache data is. Commercial web-sites listing geocache data are generally protective of their data.People using publicly available data taken from geocaching.com have been threatened with lawsuits by Groundspeak, Inc., the owners of geocaching.com. One of the most notable examples of this is that of Ed Hall who in 2001 was threatened with a lawsuit if he didn t place a notice stating that all geocaching data used in the creation of his geocache maps was copyrighted by Groundspeak, Inc. The legal advice received by Hall suggested that such a notice was unnecessary but his site now acknowledges the various sources of cache data i donot have any.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 746
Geocaching is when you find the quordinants for a certain cache on the internet, set them into your gps, and then have the gps tell you where to drive, and when you get close enough, walk. It s pretty fun.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is a disease of the myocardium (the muscle of the heart) in which a portion of the myocardium is hypertrophied (thickened) without any obvious cause.1,10,22,29-31 Though perhaps most famous as a leading causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes2 HCM s more important significance is as a cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group and as a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms.A cardiomyopathy is any disease that primarily affects the muscle of the heart. In HCM, the normal alignment of muscle cells is disrupted, a phenomenon known as myocardial disarray. HCM also causes disruptions of the electrical functions of the heart. HCM is believed to be due to a mutation in one of many genes that results in a mutated myosin heavy chain, one of the components of the myocyte (the muscle cell of the heart). Depending on the degree of obstruction of the outflow of blood from the left ventricle of the heart, HCM can be defined as obstructive or non-obstructive.HCM is also known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). A non-obstructive variant of HCM is apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 3, which is also known as nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Japanese variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (since the first cases described were all in individuals of Japanese descent).Definetly there is treatment for HOCM.  Please go thro the following website for information and get hold of a good codiologist and have treatement under his advise.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathyBest of Luck

QUESTION SUBJECT: What hockey teams do you hate and why???
QUESTION CONTENT: I dislike the Wings, the Devils, the Habs, the Flyers, The Avs, the Oilers, the Sharks,  the Stars, and Ottawa.  They are all pertentious teams that play a style of hockey I hate....the TRAP!!!I like the Preds, I like the Kings, I like the Leafs, I like the Hurricanes, I like Tampa Bay, I like the Penns, I like the Hawks, I like the Canucks ok, I try to root for the Rangers cause my bro is from NY and he is a Rangers fan, I like the Trashers because of their talent players.   I do like players from teams I hate.  I love my hockey and respect the players, even if I hate the team.  I hate Detroit and some other teams because they remind of the Yankees and trying to buy championships.  I do have a lot more tolerance for Detroit because of the kids that stepped up last year in the playoffs.Yes you retard, I do know there is a salary cap now, do you think I just started hating these teams this year???  DO you think I just started watching hockey after the lockout????   Think before you respond, and......every team has a different salary cap, look into it champ, there is a ceiling, yes, set by the NHL that you cannot go over, but smaller market teams have smaller salary caps.For the person that said hockey in the south is boring because the fans dont get into it, you could only be referring to one team, because I know for a fact that hockey in Nashville, Carolina, and Tampa Bay is nowhere near what you describe.  Fanatics are everywhere, what you are trying to support is that lame ass opinion that if there isnt natural ice, then they shouldnt have hockey, so should basketball not be played where they dont have natural wood floors???  Stop with the Hockey is a Canadian sport and should stay there.  Ice in the rinks has to be manufactored just the same in every freaking arena.  Name one place where they play multiple home games on natural ice.  What about all the cities that do get cold and have true winters that dont have hockey teams???

I hate that if it is a really close game, and everybody is doing the wave. The wave is all fun and great when it s a blow out, but when it s close, you are supposed to be watching the game. When you are participating in the wave, you aren t watching the game, you are following the wave around the arena so when you see it come back to you, so you can stand up and continue to not watch the game.

The most intelligent question! First one must understand that we are not this material body, IE; Race, color, nationality, Religion, mind, intellect, senses, job, etc. We are all eternal spirit souls, part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, also known as Krishna, Allah, Jehovah, Vishnu, etc.  We never die, only this mortal body dies. This material world is not our real home, it is called Maya (illusion) and is temporary and full of misery, only one fourth of the souls come here, and the rest are enjoying blissful eternal loving relationships with our Maker named above. Those who are intelligent, take up the process of self realization (Bhakti Yoga) which gives one real peace, happiness and reality. Chanting the Maha Mantra or names of God is the process to attain self realization and reawaken one eternal relationship with God which we have forgotten due to Maya (Illusion) If one takes this seriously, at the end of life they can return to the eternal Kingdom where there is no more birth, death, old age, or disease and be eternally happy.  I am so glad I know who I am and what actual life is. Otherwise one will continue in the repeated cycle of birth and death and create so much karma for oneself.For info.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 517
A microphone, sometimes called a mic (pronounced mike ), is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, tape recorders, hearing aids, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, and in radio and television broadcasting.The invention of a practical microphone was crucial to the early development of the telephone system. Emile Berliner invented the first microphone on March 4, 1877, but the first useful microphone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. Many early developments in microphone design took place in Bell Laboratories.In all microphones, sound waves (sound pressure) are translated into mechanical vibrations in a thin, flexible diaphragm. These sound vibrations are then converted by various methods into an electrical signal which varies in voltage amplitude and frequency in an analog of the original sound. For this reason, a microphone is an acoustic wave to voltage modulation transducer.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Trans Fat? How to reduce that?
QUESTION CONTENT: I heard that tras fat is bad for the body.  Why is that? Where can we find it in our daily food?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2602
Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises bad LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease.<br /><br />Until very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods.

Hey Rush, you are such a pathetic Colt fan. It s amazing to me that 80% of your argument is noting things that happened against your PRECIOUS team. McGinest hurting his leg and our D-backs roughing up the timing of your precious little receivers. Your GM was the biggest cry baby on all of those occasions and demanded changes. Funny, we beat you twomore times after the changes..haha.. Who gives a crap what Belichek wears on the sidelines you freak n prima donna. Why don t you actually congratulate the Patriots on being an organization that has structure and is willing to take on these so-called troubled palyers and turn them around. See Dillion, Harrison, and now Moss. Any team would take all three of those players on their team if they knew they would be good citizens and Rodney s rep was overblown. I find it funny how you being so perfect and such an upstanding citizen enjoys watching your QB run to the line of scrimmage when teams are substituting to catch too many people on the field. That I feel is poor sportsmanship. You are just mad, because we have beaten your team to a pulp every year and last year, because our team was full of intravenous on the sideline gave that game away and the Superbowl. You know your lucky you won that game. Admit it. Oh, and that Vrabel play? You take a vote across the league and ask how many players think he is class act and you will get 99.9% of the votes. He did not hear the whistle and kept playing. This is not a dirty team. Never has been and never will. Stop scrutinizing this team. Some of you people are so pathetic. Ever team cutblocks, or hits people low. I will be taking notes against your team this Monday night and come back with a report, because I have nothing better to do like yourself. Get off your high horse and stop searching for every Patriot post so you can post your garbage. Loser. See you in November. People hate the Patriots, because they are sick of them winning all the time. It s a fact. Just like we hated the 49 ers, the Cowboys, the Steelers..etc. Any person on this board would love to be in our shoes right now.

People hate to lose and 6 teams have already lost to the patriots (and many more expected to do the same) so they are all  just upset right now. they ll get over it soon, hopefully.They need to use excuses like they cheated or there were bad calls to make them feel better they just can t accept that the Patriots are a great team. I m not trying to be mean to anyone but thats just how it seems. To be honest if/when the Patriots loose I will probably hate whatever team they loose to, for a little while atleast.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Potential Energy?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2624
Definitions of potential energy on the Web:    * The energy stored in a raised object (eg the weights in a grandfather clock). Potential energy equals mgh, where m is mass, g is the acceleration of gravity, and h is the vertical distance from a reference location. It is called potential energy because the energy can be regained when the object is lowered. This type of potential energy is sometimes called gravitational potential energy in order to distinguish it from elastic potential energy: see elastic energy.      http://urban.arch.virginia.edu/~km6e/references/glossary/struc-glossary.html    * energy stored in an object due to its position      http://whyfiles.larc.nasa.gov/text/kids/Problem_Board/problems/pulleys/glossary.html    * The energy which a body possesses as a consequence of it s position in the field of gravity, the work required to bring the body up against gravity from a standard level.      http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/oakfield/keyterms.htm    * Energy related to the position or height above a place to which fluid could possibly flow.      http://www.flw.com/define_p.htm    * The energy that matter has because of its position or because of the arrangement of atoms or parts.      http://www.nmlites.org/standards/science/glossary_4.htm    *Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object because of its height above the ground. The amount of potential energy possessed by an object depends on its mass and its height. A roller coaster car is initially hauled by a motor and chain system to the top of a tall hill, giving it a large quantity of potential energy.      http://www.learner.org/exhibits/parkphysics/glossary.html

QUESTION SUBJECT: Which team do you hate the most in college football.?
QUESTION CONTENT: I pick Michigan.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 686
I agree Michigan.I don t like teams that have cocky a-hole fans, I know all teams do but teams like Michigan, and LSU, and USC seem to have more bad fans than good fans. They call other people cocky when all I hear is these other teams defending their teams, when they talk trash, like the classless a-holes they are. I think a lot NOT ALL but a lot of SEC fans seem to be like that, or maybe it s just the ones on here.Anyone who hates Notre Dame is a dumb ass, they say lies like Notre Dame will get into a bowl game no matter their record that isn t true. How can someone hate a school that actually tries to get good athletes and not thugs, their players have to have one of the highest if not highest GPA just to get on the team, why would anyone not like a team like that, it shows that people only care about winning and not about class and sportsmanship. I do agree their fans aren t as good sports as they used to be but their players are the highest quality on and off the field... OK right now more off the field than on. HAwho ever has Terrance W. as a fan, because he must be a half wit, not to have seen that the Buckeye Miami game wouldn t have even had to go toovertime, if there were some bad pass interference and holding calls in the 4th quarter, the Hurricaned would have lost in regulation otherwise, and I watched it over and over that was a good call, lay of the crack buddy.I m like the guy who said he respects them but doesn t like them in reference to Michigan, it s funny to here them now talking trash because 2 wordsAPPALACHIAN STATEI do root for all Big Ten teams even Michigan in bowl games.

QUESTION CONTENT: I tried looking it up on Wikipedia, but didn t really understand it. If anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate it?I think it s called Pulmonary Stenosis or Pulmonary Valve Stenosis.I want to know what it is and if it s dangerous? And what safety precautions you should take if you have it?And any other information would be great. Thanks! ^_^
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2974
Pulmonary stenosis is a congenital (present at birth) defect that occurs due to abnormal development of the fetal heart during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.The pulmonary valve is found between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. It has three leaflets that function like a one-way door, allowing blood to flow forward into the pulmonary artery, but not backward into the right ventricle.With pulmonary stenosis, problems with the pulmonary valve make it harder for the leaflets to open and permit blood to flow forward from the right ventricle to the lungs. In children, these problems can include:    * a valve that has leaflets that are partially fused together.    * a valve that has thick leaflets that do not open all the way.    * the area above or below the pulmonary valve is narrowed.Read more at... http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/peds_cardiac/ps.cfm

Jesus, also known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus the Nazarene, is the central figure of Christianity, in which context he is known as Jesus Christ (from Greek ???????????? ??????????????) with Christ being a title meaning Anointed One or Messiah .Most Christians,believe Jesus is both the Son of God and God made incarnate, sent to provide reconciliation with God by atoning for humanity s sins, and acceptance of Jesus as Savior saves one from sin (John 3:16). Christians generally believe Jesus was born of a virgin, crucified and buried, resurrected on the third day of death, and ascended into Heaven where he resides at the right hand of God the Father until the Second Coming.This is the factual stuff, meet Jesus personally and He will show you who He is. A simple prayer is all it takes and you are safe in His care for eternity!

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is FRENCH REVOLUTION?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2791
The French Revolution was most likely the most world-changing event at the time. In short, France had been going through serious economic difficulties, partly because of its financial aid to the American Revolution in 1776. The King at the time, King Louis XVI was a very incompetent ruler, and he and his wife, Marie Antoinette were just more worried about being royal . One thing you have to understand, is that France also had a voting system, the Estates General, which was an assembly of representatives from the 3 estates; The Clergy (those affiliated with religion), the Nobles, and the common folk, often known as the bourgoisie. Now, the last few monarchs had not called a meeting of the Estates General for over 100 years, and so the people were getting angry when the king tried to tax them even more than they already were. So, he was forced to call a meeting. Now, the Third Estate, or the Bourgoisie, knew that voting would not be fair. Since votes were done by Estate, a simple 2/3 majority would have made any legislation passed. This meant that if there was a bill to tax the Third Estate, if the Clergy and the Nobles voted for it, the Third Estate would be taxed, even though they voted against it.          This was exactly what happened, and so they formed a new order, the National Assembly, in 1789. From here, they took complete control, which wasn t too hard, considering that the Third Estate made up 97% of the French population at the time. A lot of radical changes occured at this time, the most radical being that France was declared a republic, not a monarchy. Well of course, that was a cause for concern for King Louis, who feigned support of the revolutionists, just to save their skin. Even then, it wasn t going to help him and his family, because the National Assembly decided the best way to kick off a new republic, was by kicking off the heads of the King and Queen. So, using the newly invented guillotine, they were beheaded. That was pretty much the start of an almost 20 year revolution, the details of which you can find online at various sources.

French Revolution The event at the end of the eighteenth century that ended the thousand-year rule ofkings in France and established the nation as a republic. The revolution began in 1789, after King Louis xvi had convened the French parliament to deal with an enormous national debt. The common people s division of the parliament declared itself the true legislature of France, and when the king seemed to resist the move, a crowd destroyed the royal prison (the Bastille). A constitutional monarchy was set up, but after King Louis and his queen, Marie Antoinette, tried to flee the country, they were arrested, tried for treason, and executed on the guillotine. Control of the government passed to Robespierre and other radicals ??? the extreme Jacobins ??? and the Reign of Terror followed (1793-1794), when thousands of French nobles and others considered enemies of the revolution were executed. After the Terror, Robespierre himself was executed, and a new ruling body, the Directory, came into power. Its incompetence and corruption allowed Napoleon Bonaparte to emerge in 1799 as dictator and, eventually, to become emperor. Napoleon s ascent to power is considered the official end of the revolution. (See Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat.)

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Quantum Theory?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2671
quantum theoryn.A theory in physics based on the principle that matter and energy have the properties of both particles and waves, created to explain the radiation of energy from a blackbody, the photoelectric effect, and the Bohr theory, and now used to account for a wide range of physical phenomena, including the existence of discrete packets of energy and matter, the uncertainty principle, and the exclusion principle. Any of various specific applications of this theory.quantum theory, modern physical theory concerned with the emission and absorption of energy by matter and with the motion of material particles; the quantum theory and the theory of relativity together form the theoretical basis of modern physics. Just as the theory of relativity assumes importance in the special situation where very large speeds are involved, so the quantum theory is necessary for the special situation where very small quantities are involved, i.e., on the scale of molecules, atoms, and elementary particles. Aspects of the quantum theory have provoked vigorous philosophical debates concerning, for example, the uncertainty principle and the statistical nature of all the predictions of the theory.Relationship of Energy and MatterAccording to the older theories of classical physics,energy is treated solely as a continuous phenomenon, while matter is assumed to occupy a very specific region of space and to move in a continuous manner. According to the quantum theory, energy is held to be emitted and absorbed in tiny, discrete amounts. An individual bundle or packet of energy, called a quantum (pl. quanta), thus behaves in some situations much like particles of matter; particles are found to exhibit certain wavelike properties when in motion and are no longer viewed as localized in a given region but rather as spread out to some degree.For example, the light or other radiation given off or absorbed by an atom has only certain frequencies (or wavelengths), as can be seen from the line spectrum associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or photons, and result from the fact that the electrons of the atom can have only certain allowed energy values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels.Dual Nature of Waves and ParticlesThe restriction of the energy levels of the electrons is explained in terms of the wavelike properties of their motions: electrons occupy only those orbits for which their associated wave is a standing wave (i.e., the circumference of the orbit is exactly equal to a whole number of wavelengths) and thus can have only those energies that correspond to such orbits. Moreover, the electrons are no longer thought of as being at a particular point in the orbit but rather as being spread out over the entire orbit. Just as the results of relativity approximate those of Newtonian physics when ordinary speeds are involved, the results of the quantum theory agree with those of classical physics when very large ???quantum numbers??? are involved, i.e., on the ordinary large scale of events; this agreement in theclassical limit is required by the correspondence principle of Niels Bohr. The quantum theory thus proposes a dual nature for both waves and particles, one aspect predominating in some situations, the other predominating in other situations.Evolution of Quantum TheoryEarly DevelopmentsWhile the theory of relativity was largely the work of one man, Albert Einstein, the quantum theory was developed principally over a period of thirty years through the efforts of many scientists. The first contribution was the explanation of black body radiation in 1900 by Max Planck, who proposed that the energies of any harmonic oscillator (see harmonic motion), such as the atoms of a black body radiator, are restricted to certain values, each of which is an integral (whole number) multiple of a basic, minimum value. The energy E of this basic quantum is directly proportional to the frequency nu of the oscillator, or E=hnu, where h is a constant, now called Planck s constant, having the value 6.63??10???34 joule-second. In 1905, Einstein proposed that the radiation itself is also quantized according to this same formula, and he used the new theory to explain the photoelectric effect. Following the discovery of the nuclear atom by Rutherford (1911), Bohr used the quantum theory in 1913 to explain both atomic structure and atomic spectra, showing the connection between the electrons energy levels and the frequencies of light given off and absorbed.Quantum Mechanics and Later DevelopmentsQuantum mechanics, the final mathematical formulation of the quantum theory, was developed during the 1920s. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particlelike properties, as in the photoelectric effect and atomic spectra, but particles may also exhibit wavelike properties. This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally in 1927 by C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, who observed diffraction of a beam of electrons analogous to the diffraction of a beam of light. Two different formulations of quantum mechanics were presented following de Broglie s suggestion. The wave mechanics of Erwin Schr??dinger (1926) involves the use of a mathematical entity, the wave function, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. The matrix mechanics of Werner Heisenberg (1925) makes no mention of wave functions or similar concepts but was shown to be mathematically equivalent to Schr??dinger s theory.Quantum mechanics was combined with the theory of relativity in the formulation of P. A. M. Dirac (1928), which, in addition, predicted the existence of antiparticles. A particularly important discovery of the quantum theory is the uncertainty principle, enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927, which places an absolute theoretical limit on the accuracy of certain measurements; as a result, the assumption by earlier scientists that the physical state of a system could be measured exactly and used to predict future states had to be abandoned. Other developments of the theory include quantum statistics, presented in one form by Einstein and S. N. Bose (the Bose-Einstein statistics) and in another by Dirac and Enrico Fermi (the Fermi-Dirac statistics); quantum electrodynamics, concerned with interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic fields; its generalization, quantum field theory; and quantum electronics.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 521
it is the theory of how subatomic particlesbehave
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 788
Quantum theory proposes that electromagnetic energy exists only in tiny packets called quanta.  For example it is well established that an atom can be modeled as a tiny nucleus surrounded by one or more electrons orbiting it.  The electrons move in shells which could be visualized (if we were small enough) as concentric hollow shells.  Inner shells of atoms represent minimum energy levels and outer shells sucessively represent higher energy levels.  It takes more energy to place a rocket into a higher orbit, right?  The shells of different atoms are larger or smaller depending on the size of their nuclei. When a quantum of energy (a light photon) enters and interacts with an atom (or an atom which is part of a molecule) it adds a quantum of energy to an electron kicking it from an inner shell to an outer shell (some shells may be empty at rest).  Later (but often instantaneously), the electron may drop back to its inner shell giving back the energy as a quantum photon.  If the original photon kicked the electron out three shells, the electron may drop back in one or more steps to its lowest energy state yielding one or more separate photons, one for each shell it stops at on the way back to its inner shell.When the quanta of photons are given off by a particular element, they produce visible and invisible light rays that can be observed using a prism that separates light into different wavelengths and colors.  An element can be detected by its characteristic spectra or sharp spectral lines when apure sample is heated to incandescence.  That is how helium (named after the sun) was discovered in the spectra of the sun; before helium gas was discovered on earth!All energy (heat, light, chemical and nuclear, etc.) exists as quanta.  Einstein s equation E = mc2 shows how a tiny mass multiplied by the speed of light squared can be converted into a relatively large amount of quantum energy.

Check out Yahoo!Health for more information and/or the following websiteshttp://www.cancer.orghttp://www.skincancer.orghttp://www.jhu.edu/wctb/coms.htmlSkin cancer is the most common of all cancers, with doctors detecting skin cancer in about 1 million Americans each year.Reducing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight can prevent most skin cancers. If skin cancer is found early, it can usually be cured by relatively simple surgery. Skin cancer is responsible for less than 1% of all cancer deaths.The skin, the body s largest organ, protects against infection and injury and helps regulate body temperature. The skin also stores water and fat and produces vitamin D. Skin is made up of two main layers: the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and the dermis (inner layer of skin).Basal cell carcinoma. Cells in the lower epidermis are round cells known as basal cells. About 80% of skin cancer develops from this type of cell that has been exposed to the sun and is called basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma most often forms on the head and neck.Here are a list of Resources as well:PLWC Guide to Skin Cancer (Non-Melanoma)  Overview Medical Illustrations Risk Factors and Prevention Symptoms Diagnosis Staging Treatment Side Effects of Cancer and Cancer Treatment After Treatment Current Research Patient Information Resources Clinical Trials Resources Questions to Ask the Doctor   What s New 2005 Meet the Expert: Target Therapies - The Next Generation Q&A Forum Transcript: Cancer, Sexual Health, and Fertility  Information&Support Ask the ASCO Expert Series Transcripts Patient Information Resources  Cancer News Latest Cancer News Sign Up for the PLWC Bulletin PLWC Features    OverviewThis section has been reviewed and approved by the PLWC Editorial Board, 1/05This section describes basal cell and squamous cell cancers.

Skin cancer is responsible for less than 1% of all cancer deaths.The skin, the body s largest organ, protects against infection and injury and helps regulate body temperature. The skin also stores water and fat and produces vitamin D. Skin is made up of two main layers: the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and the dermis (inner layer of skin).Types of skin cancerThere are three main types of skin cancer:Squamous cell carcinoma. Most of the epidermis is made up of flat, scale-like cells called squamous cells. Approximately 16% of skin cancer resembles these cells and is called squamous cell carcinoma. They usually arise from sun exposure, but can appear on skin that has been burned, damaged by chemicals, or exposed to x-rays.Basal cell carcinoma. Cells in the lower epidermis are round cells known as basal cells. About 80% of skin cancer develops from this type of cell that has been exposed to the sun and is called basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma most often forms on the head and neck.Melanoma. Where the epideimis meets the dermis, there are scattered cells called melanocytes, which produce the melanin that gives skin color. Melanoma starts in melanocytes, and it is the most serious of the three cancer types. For information on melanoma, read the PLWC Guide to Melanoma.Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are known as non-melanoma skin cancers, to distinguish them from melanoma, which arises from very different cells and is treated differently.Typically, non-melanoma skin cancer can be treated with relatively simple surgery. Or, if the cancer is very small, cryosurgery (freezing) or laser surgery may be used. Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly and rarely metastasizes (spreads) to other parts of the body. Squamous cell carcinoma also rarely spreads, but is more likely to spread than basal cell carcinoma.StatisticsIn 2006, more than 1 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer is expected to be diagnosed in the United States. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are highly curable, and are not traditionally included in overall cancer statistics. Each year, approximately 2,800 people die from non-melanoma skin cancer.Basal cell carcinoma. The overall five-year relative survival rate (the percentage of patients who survive at least five years after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other diseases) of people diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma is greater than 99%. Less than one-tenth of 1% of these tumors spread to other parts of the body. If basal cell carcinoma spreads, the five-year relative survival rate is much lower.Squamous cell carcinoma. The overall five-year relative survival rate of people with squamous cell carcinoma is greater than 95%. If the disease spreads to other parts of the body, the five-year relative survival rate is lower. However, it is estimated that only a small percentage of these tumors will spread.Cancer statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States each year, but the actual risk for a particular individual may differ. It is not possible to tell a person how long he or she will live with non-melanoma skin cancer. Because the survival statistics are measured in five-year (or sometimes one-year) intervals, they may not represent advances made in the treatment or diagnosis of this cancer.Statistics adapted from the American Cancer Society s publication, Cancer Facts&Figures 2006. Medical IllustrationsLarger image Risk Factors and PreventionA risk factor is anything that increases a person s chance of developing a disease, including cancer. There are risk factors that can be controlled, such as smoking, and risk factors that cannot be controlled, such as age and family history. Although risk factors can influence disease, for many risk factors it is not known whether they actually cause the disease directly. Some people with several risk factors never develop the disease, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and communicating with your doctor can help guide you in making wise lifestyle and health-care choices.The following factors increase the risk of developing skin cancer:Exposure to UV radiation. Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation causes sunburn and plays a role in the development of basal and squamous cell cancers. Ultraviolet A (UVA) penetrates the skin more deeply, and contributes to photoaging or wrinkling. The role of UVA in the development of non-melanoma skin cancer is suspected, but not yet certain. People who live in areas with year-round, bright sunlight (both UVA and UVB) or at high altitudes have a higher risk of developing skin cancer, as do those who spend excess time outside or on a tanning bed (mostly UVA).Fair skin. Less pigment (melanin) in skin offers poorer protection against UV radiation. People with light hair and light-colored eyes who have skin that tans poorly or freckles, or those who burn easily, are more likely to develop skin cancer.Gender. Rates of skin cancer in white males have increased in recent years.Age. Most basal cell andsquamous cell cancers appear after age 50, but may appear earlier in individuals with sun-damaged skin.A history of sunburns or fragile skin. Skin that has been burned, sunburned, or injured from disease is at higher risk for skin cancer. Squamous cell and basal cell cancers more often occur with higher lifetime exposure to the sun or UV radiation.Individual history. People with weakened immune systems or those who use certain medications (such as immunosuppressive drugs, certain steroids, and drugs that make the skin sensitive to light) are at higher risk for developing skin cancer, particularly squamous cell cancers. People with very rare predisposing genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, or albinism, are at much higher risk for developing skin cancer.Previous skin cancer. People who have had any form of skin cancer are at a higher risk for developing another skin cancer. Thirty-five percent (35%) to 50% of people diagnosed with one basal cell cancer will develop a new skin cancer within five years. Thus, people who have had one skin cancer need to be followed closely to screen for additional cancers.Precancerous skin conditions. Two types of lesions, known as actinic keratoses, characterized by rough, red or brown scaly patches on the skin, or Bowen s disease are usually more common in areas exposed to the sun. Such areas can change into squamous cell cancers in some people. Bowen s disease in non-sun-exposed areas may be related to arsenic exposure. Use of sunscreens may decrease the risk of actinic keratoses.Viral infection. People infected with a specific type of human papillomavirus (HPV) are at increased risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma, particularly if their immune system becomes suppressed.PreventionReducing exposure to UV radiation lowers the risk of melanoma. This is important for all age groups, but is especially important for persons who have risk factors for melanoma. Sun damage is cumulative, meaning it increases over time. Steps to reduce exposure and help prevent many case of melanoma include: Preventing sunburnLimiting or avoiding sun exposure between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PMWearing sun-protective clothing and a hat that shades the face, neck, and ears. Clothes made of fabric labeled with UPF (UV protection factor) may provide better protection. UV-protective sunglasses are also recommended.Using sunscreen with a solar protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher throughout the year and reapplying it often, especially after heavy perspiration or being in the waterExamining skin regularly (examinations by a health-care professional and self-examinations)Avoiding use of sun lamps and tanning beds or parlorsSymptomsPeople with skin cancer usually experience few, if any, symptoms. Or, these symptoms may be similar to symptoms of other medical conditions. Listed below are the skin features that frequently occur in basal or squamous cell carcinomas. If you are concerned about a symptom or a feature on this list, please talk to your doctor.Changes in the skin are the main warning sign for skin cancer. Each type of skin cancer can appear differently, and an accurate diagnosis by a health-care practitioner is essential.For basal cell cancer, two or more of the following features may be present: An open sore that bleeds, oozes, or crusts, and remains open for several weeksA reddish, raised patch or irritated area that may crust or itch, and rarely hurtsA shiny pink, red, or white pearly or translucent bumpA pink growth with an elevated border and crusted central indentationA scar-like, white, yellow, or waxy area, often poorly definedSquamous cell cancer can often crust and bleed and appears as: A wart-like growthA persistent, scaly red patch with irregular borders that may bleed easilyAn open sore that persists for weeksAn elevated growth with a rough surface and a central depressionEarly detection: finding skin cancer earlyPeriodic self-examinations may help find skin cancer early. Examinations should be performed in front of a full-length mirror in a brightly lit room. It helps to have another person check the scalp and back of the neck. Non-melanoma skin cancer most often begins on skin that has frequently been exposed to the sun.A doctor should be consulted for: Growths on the skin that match any symptoms on either of the above listsNew growth on the skinSuspicious changes in an existing mole or spotA sore that doesn t heal within two weeksDiagnosisDoctors use many tests to diagnose cancer and determine if it has metastasized (spread). Some tests may also determine which treatments may be the most effective. For most types of cancer, a biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of cancer. If a biopsy is not possible, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis. Imaging tests may be used to find out whether the cancer has metastasized. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test: Age and medical condition The type of cancer Severity of symptoms Previous test resultsBecause basal cell and squamous cell cancers rarely spread, a biopsy is often the only test needed to determine the stage of cancer. In a biopsy, the doctor removes all or part of the growth, and the tissue is examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells. No further treatment beyond the biopsy may be necessary if the entire growth is removed. If the cancer is present at the edges of the biopsy, additional surgery will usually be necessary. StagingStaging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, where it has spread, and if it is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the cancer s stage, so staging may not be complete until all the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient s prognosis (chance of recovery).On rare occasions, lymph nodes may be removed from the patient to determine if the cancer has metastasized. Even more uncommonly, the doctor may perform other tests, including a blood sample, chest x-ray, and diagnostic scans of the liver, bones, and brain. TreatmentThrough ongoing research, the medications used to treat cancer are constantly being evaluated in different combinations and to treat different cancers. Talking with your doctor is often the best way to learn about the medications you ve been prescribed, their purpose, and their potential side effects or interactions. For more information, see Drug Information Resources.The treatment of skin cancer depends on the size and location of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread, and the person s overall health. In many cases, a team of doctors, including a dermatologist, surgeon, radiation therapist, and medical oncologist, will work with the patient to determine the best treatment plan.SurgeryMany superficial skin cancers can be removed from the skin quickly and easily, and often no further treatment is needed. Most of these treatments use a local anesthetic and can be done outside of a hospital, either by a dermatologist, a general surgeon, or a plastic surgeon. Different types of surgical procedures are used depending on the size of the cancer and where it is located.Curettage and electrodessication. In this common procedure, the cancer is removed with a curette, a sharp, spoon-shaped instrument. The area can then be treated with electrodessication, which uses an electric current to control bleeding and kill any remaining cancer cells. Many people have a flat, white scar from this procedure.Mohs surgery. This technique involves removing the visible tumor, in addition to small fragments of the edge where the tumor existed. Each small fragment is examined under a microscope until all cancer is removed. This is typically used for larger tumors, those in hard to reach places, and for cancers that have come back in the same place.Freezing. Used primarily on precancerous skin conditions, this procedure (known as cryosurgery) uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill cells. The skin will later blister and slough off. This procedure will sometimes leave a white scar. More than one freezing may be needed.Laser therapy. A narrow beam of high-intensity light can remove or destroy precancer confined to the outer layer of the skin.Grafting. When a large tumor is removed, surgeons may use a skin graft from another area to both close the wound and reduce scarring.Radiation therapyThis procedure can be used for skin cancer that is hard to treat with surgery, such as skin cancer that appears on the eyelid, tip of the nose, and ear. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to damage cancer cells, and several treatments may be needed. The treatment may produce a rash, make the skin dry or red, or change the color of the skin.Topical chemotherapyFor cancers limited to the top layer of the skin or to treat precancerous skin conditions, doctors may prescribe chemotherapy drugs in a cream or lotion formula. These drugs are usually applied daily for several weeks. They may cause inflammation, which later goes away.Advanced skin cancerIn rare cases, squamous cell cancer can grow deeper into the skin and can spread to other parts of the body. Sites of a chronic inflammatory skin condition, mucous membranes (skin that lines the mouth, nose, vagina, and anus), and the lips are most susceptible to squamous cell cancer.Surgery alone is not effective in treating skin cancer that has metastasized. To control this distant spread, a person s health-care team may recommend chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation. Side Effects of Cancer and Cancer TreatmentCancer and cancer treatment can cause a variety of side effects; some are easily controlled and others require specialized care. Below are some of the side effects that are more common to skin cancer and its treatments. For more detailed information on managing these and other side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, visit the PLWC Managing Side Effects section.Skin problems. The skin is an organ system that contains many nerves. Because of this, skin problems can be very painful. Because the skin is on the outside of the body and visible to others, many patients find skin problems especially difficult to cope with. Because the skin protects the inside of the body from infection, skin problems can often lead to other serious problems. As with other side effects, prevention or early treatment is best. In other cases, treatment and wound care can often improve pain and quality of life. Skin problems can have many different causes, including chemotherapeutic drugs leaking out of the intravenous (IV) tube, which can cause pain or burning; peeling or burned skin caused by radiation therapy; pressure ulcers (bed sores) caused by constant pressure on one area of the body; and pruritus (itching) in patients with cancer, most often caused by leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, or other cancers. After TreatmentSince non-melanoma skin cancer is frequently occurs on the face, a plastic surgeon or facial specialist may be consulted for complicated surgical procedures. This specialist should be able to fully discuss the impact of the surgery on a person s appearance. People who have multiple surgeries on their face may have a substantially altered appearance. Rarely, the eyelid may be altered.The eyelid may not close well, and the person may need to use drops to moisten the eye. In those rare cases, when extensive facial surgery is necessary, the person will need support and possibly the help of a caregiver during treatment. Some of these surgeries are multi-stage surgeries and may require prolonged absence from work. Since a relatively high proportion of people who have one skin cancer will have several skin cancers, ongoing surveillance by health-care professionals is important.Usually treatment of a skin cancer involves removal of a small part of the skin without disturbing the underlying structures. Little, if any, rehabilitation is needed.Use of sun protective measures, as described above, is essential. Also, frequent surveillance examinations (whole body skin examinations) are necessary to detect additional, new skin cancer.People are encouraged to talk with their doctors about following a healthy diet that includes antioxidants.Since surgery is the primary treatment used, there are few late effects of treatment, except for potential scarring. In the rare cases, when radiation therapy is used, there is the possibility of a radiation-induced second tumor. These tumors, however, often do not appear for over 10 years. Chemotherapy is only used extremely rarely in advanced disease. It is unlikely that the chemotherapy for advanced disease would have common late effects. It is important to note that chemotherapy is not curative for advanced squamous cell carcinoma and is unlikely to cause leukemia.Many people who are diagnosed with skin cancer lead an active, outdoor lifestyle. After being diagnosed with skin cancer, many people become concerned about how they will continue their outdoor hobbies (such as hiking, running, and swimming) while, at the same time, protecting themselves from further skin damage. For example, a woman newly diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma might begin to feel isolated if she believes she can no longer be outdoors in the sun and hike. This sense of isolation and loss of a favorite hobby may cause someone to become depressed and withdrawn. It is important for an individual in this situation to feel connected and hopeful for the future. Changing the time of the hikes to before 10:00 AM and wearing long sleeves, long pants, sunscreen, and a hat would help this individual to continue to participate in something that she greatly enjoys.However, if the person diagnosed with basal skin carcinoma is experiencing pain from surgery, this needs to be considered, and he or she should be encouraged to speak with a pain management specialist. Current ResearchResearch involving more advanced diagnostic procedures and treatment for skin cancer is ongoing. The following advancements may still be under investigation in clinical trials and may not be approved or available at this current time. Always discuss all diagnostic and treatment options with your doctor.Photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy involves a cream or other medication that may be combined with light or laser therapy to remove identified skin lesions.COX inhibitors for actinic keratoses. As far as preventing second malignancies (cancers), there are ongoing clinical trials of COX inhibitors and actinic keratoses, and topicals for use on actinic keratoses. Consult a doctor for more information.Imiquimod for superficial squamous cell carcinoma (in situ). Imiquimod (Aldara) is a type of immune response modifier in which the body uses its own immune system as a method of treatment. Consult your doctor for more information.

The Most Common Skin Cancer Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, affecting 800,000 Americans each year. In fact, it is the most common of all cancers. One out of every three new cancers is a skin cancer, and the vast majority arebasal cell carcinomas, often referred to by the abbreviation, BCC. These cancers arise in the basal cells, which are at the bottom of the epidermis (outer skin layer). Until recently, those most often affected were older people, particularly men who had worked outdoors. Although the number of new cases has increased sharply each year in the last few decades, the average age of onset of the disease has steadily decreased. More women are getting BCCs than in the past; nonetheless, men still outnumber them greatly. The Major CauseChronic exposure to sunlight is the cause of almost all basal cell carcinomas, which occur most frequently on exposed parts of the body -- the face, ears, neck, scalp, shoulders, and back. Rarely, however, tumors develop on non-exposed areas. In a few cases, contact with arsenic, exposure to radiation, and complications of burns, scars, vaccinations, or even tattoos are contributing factors. Who Gets ItAnyone with a history of frequent sun exposure can develop BCC. But people who have fair skin, blonde or red hair, and blue, green, or gray eyes are at highest risk. Those whose occupations require long hours outdoors or who spend extensive leisure time in the sun are in particular jeopardy. What to Look ForThe five most typical characteristics of basal cell carcinoma are shown below. Frequently, two or more features are present in one tumor. In addition, basal cell carcinoma sometimes resembles non-cancerous skin conditions such as psoriasis or eczema. Only a trained physician, usually a specialist in diseases of the skin, can decide for sure. Learn the signs of basal cell carcinoma, and examine your skin regularly -- once a month, or more often if you are at high risk. Be sure to include the scalp, backs of ears, neck, and other hard-to-see areas. (A full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror can be very useful). If you observe any of the warning signs or some other change in your skin, consult your physician immediately. The Skin Cancer Foundation advises people to have a total-body skin exam by a dermatologist at regular intervals. The physician will suggest the correct time frame for follow-up visits, depending on your specific risk factors, such as skin type and history of sun exposure. The Five Warning Signs of Basal Cell Carcinoma  An Open Sore that bleeds, oozes, or crusts and remains open for three or more weeks. A persistent, non-healing sore is a very common sign of an early basal cell carcinoma.             A Reddish Patch or irritated area, frequently occurring on the chest, shoulders, arms, or legs. Sometimes the patch crusts. It may also itch or hurt. At other times, it persists with no noticeable discomfort.            A Shiny Bump, or nodule, that is pearly or translucent and is often pink, red, or white. The bump can also be tan, black, or brown, especially in dark-haired people, and can be confused with a mole.            A Pink Growth with a slightly elevated rolled border and a crusted indentation in the center. As the growth slowly enlarges, tiny blood vessels may develop on the surface.            A Scar-like Area which is white, yellow or waxy, and often has poorly defined borders. The skin itself appears shiny and taut. This warning sign can indicate the presence of an aggressive tumor.         Treatment Options If skin cancer is suspected, a biopsy must be taken and examined microscopically. If the diagnosis is confirmed, there are many treatment options from which to choose. Topical MedicationsIn addition to being used to treat actinic keratosis (AK), the most common skin precancer, Imiquimod and 5-FU are also approved for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC).Curettage and ElectrodesiccationThe growth is scraped off with a curette and the tumor site desiccated with an electrocautery needle.  The procedure is typically repeated a few times to help assure that all cancer cells are eliminated.  Local anesthesia is required.Excisional SurgeryAlong with the above procedure, this is one of the most common treatments for BCCs and SCCs. Using a scalpel, the physician removes the entire growth along with a surrounding border of apparently normal skin as a safety margin. The incision is closed, and the growth is sent to the laboratory to verify that all cancerous cells have been removed.RadiationX-ray beams are directed at the tumor.  Total destruction usually requires several treatments a week for a few weeks.  This is ideal for tumors that are hard to manage surgically and for elderly patients who are in poor health.Mohs Micrographic Surgery The physician removes the visible tumor with a curette or scalpel and then removes very thin layers of the remaining surrounding skin one layer at a time. Each layer is checkedunder a microscope, and the procedure is repeated until the last layer viewed is cancer-free.  This technique has the highest cure rate and can save the greatest amount of healthy tissue. It is often used for tumors that have recurred or are in hard-to-treat places such as the head, neck, hands, and feet. CryosurgeryLiquid nitrogen is applied to the growths with a cotton-tipped applicator or spray device. This freezes them without requiring any cutting or anesthesia. They subsequently blister or become crusted and fall off. The procedure may be repeated to ensure total destruction of malignant cells.  Some temporary redness and swelling can occur.  In some patients, pigment may be lost.Laser SurgeryThe skin???s outer layer and variable amounts of deeper skin are removed using a carbon dioxide or erbium YAG laser. Lasers are effective for removing actinic cheilitis from the lips and AKs from the face and scalp. They give the physician good control over the depth of tissue removed, much like chemical peels. Lasers are also used as a secondary therapy when topical medications or other techniques are unsuccessful.  However, local anesthesia may be required. The risks of scarring and pigment loss are slightly greater than with other techniques.

Basal cell skin cancer (carcinoma) most often appears on areas of the body that have been exposed to the sun, such as the head, face, neck, back, chest, or shoulders. Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly and does not usually spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). Basal cell skin carcinoma is the most common skin cancer in light-skinned people. It is rare in people who have dark skin.Signs and symptoms may include:A small, fleshy bump with a smooth, pearly appearance, often with an indentation in the middle.A scarlike lesion that is firm to the touch.A bump that bleeds, crusts over, and then repeats the cycle.A red, tender, flat spot that bleeds easily.Tiny blood vessels in thin red lines with a spiderlike appearance (telangiectasias).Treatment for a basal cell cancer involves surgery to remove the lesion and occasionally topical chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Most basal cell skin cancer can be cured, but some may return after treatment.  .

I had Basal cell cancer next to my eye for years and I ignored it. Finally I went to a dermo. man. They remove it and check it for the cancer and if they got it all while you wait. My doctor made me very comfortable. He had to go back in twice. My fault for putting it off for so many years.It is a cancer you get from the sun.  They cover it and then you have to change the dressings, ect. They warned me about the first time I uncovered it because it does look bad.The results were wonderful. No more cancer. He gave me scarring cream to use and you can t even see where he cut. It will spread so don t put if off. I was very lucky, mine had not gone too far.Some people have to go back more than once.

Vasectomy is a surgical procedure in which the vasa deferentia of a male mammal are cut for the purpose of sterilization. There are some variations on the procedure such as no-scalpel (keyhole) vasectomies, in which a surgical hook, rather than a scalpel, is used to enter the scrotum.After vasectomy, the testes remain in the scrotum where Leydig cells continue to produce testosterone and other male hormones that continue to be secreted into the bloodstream. Some studies find that sexual desire (libido) is unaffected in over 90% of vasectomized men whereas other studies find higher rates of diminished sexual desire. The sperm-filled fluid from the testes contributes about 10% to the volume of an ejaculation (in men who are not vasectomized) and does not significantly affect the appearance, texture, smell or flavor of the ejaculate.When the vasectomy is complete, sperm can no longer exit the body through the penis. They are broken down and absorbed by the body. Much fluid content is absorbed by membranes in the epididymis, and much solid content is broken down by macrophages and re-absorbed via the blood stream. Sperm is matured in the epididymis for about a month once it leaves the testicles. Approximately 50% of thesperm produced never make it to ejaculation in a non-vasectomized man. After vasectomy, the membranes increase in size to absorb more fluid, and more macrophages are recruited to break down and re-absorb more of the solid content. The fraction of sperms that exceed the digestive capabilities of macrophages exit into the scrotum as sperm granulomas.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2674
Polycystic Ovary SyndromeWhat is polycystic ovary syndrome? Who gets it?If your hormones don t work in the normal way, your ovaries might make too many eggs. Those eggs turn into many cysts. The cysts (say: sists ) are like little balloons filled with liquid.Polycystic ovary syndrome is called PCOS for short. Women in their childbearing years can get it. It often begins in the teenage years. It doesn t go away.What are the signs of PCOS?Usually, women with PCOS have irregular menstrual periods. After a while, some women stop having any periods. Women with PCOS may have trouble getting pregnant.About 70 percent of women with PCOS have extra hair growing in the sideburn area of their face and on their chin, upper lip, nipple area, chest, lower abdomen and thighs. They may get acne. About half are obese. Some women with PCOS have no signs of it.What causes PCOS?Doctors don t know what causes PCOS. If you have PCOS, you may have a problem with the way your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Because of this problem, the hormones that control your ovaries and menstrual periods can become abnormal.Does PCOS cause long-term problems?If you have PCOS,you are more likely to get high blood pressure or diabetes. This means you have a greater risk for strokes and heart attacks.Because of irregular menstrual periods, women with PCOS are more likely to be infertile (unable to get pregnant). They may also have a higher risk for cancer of the uterus or breast.How can my doctor tell that I have PCOS?Your doctor will look for the signs of PCOS. Blood tests that measure your hormone levels can help. An ultrasound exam can show if you have cysts on your ovaries.How is PCOS treated?If you have PCOS, you might need to lose weight. Medicine can help with your menstrual cycle, abnormal hair growth and acne. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, they have to be treated. If you want to have a baby, there are medicines that may help you get pregnant.

I ve heard a drop or two on your finger could kill you.It spoils canned food, and can make the can bulge.Never eat food from a can that has been damaged.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2722
Botulism is a disease caused by the toxins (poisons) produced by several members of the group of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. These bacteria are found in soil throughout the world and produce spores that are able to survive in a dormant state until more favorable conditions allow them to grow. Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods contaminated with botulinum spores that grow into bacteria and produce neurotoxin in the food. A common cause of this illness is improperly preserved home-processed foods with low acid content, such as green beans, beets, and corn. Less likely sources include fish products and other commercially processed foods. The actual number of cases in the United States is small with approximately 9 outbreaks of foodborne botulism per year with and average of 2.4 cases per outbreak.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Valery Gazzaev?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 213
spell it properly :-(Valery Gazzayev is CSKA Moscow coachGeorgi Aleksandrovich Yartsev (???????????????? ???????????????????????????? ????????????) (born April 11, 1948 in Nikolskoye, Kostroma Oblast, Russia, USSR) is a Russian soccer coach and former player, until 2005 the head coach of the Russian national team.He learned to play soccer in the Tekmash Kostroma soccer school. Played forward for Spartak Kostroma (1965-1967, 1975-1976), Iskra Smolensk (1968-1972), CSKA Moscow (1970), Gomselmash Gomel (1973-1974), Spartak Moscow (1977-1980), Lokomotiv Moscow (1981), Moskvich Moscow (1982). Played 82 games and scored 38 goals in the premier league of the USSR championship. USSR champion in 1979. Top scorer of the USSR championship in 1978 (19 goals). Played 5 games for the USSR national team. His playing career was unusual in that he only got to the highest level of club soccer in USSR when he was 29 (not counting his 1 game for CSKA in 1970), playing in lower leagues before that, but achieved highest level success quickly once he got to Spartak Moscow. However, that sudden late-career revival did not last for too long and he retired soon thereafter.After that he became a coach. Coached at Kapotnya Moscow soccer school (1982-1984), Krasnaya Presnya Moscow (1984-1985), SC Krasny Bogatyr Moscow (1985-1988), pop singers team that played exhibition games, Zvezdy Sporta (1993-1994).In 1994 was hired as an assistant coach for the top Russian club at the time, Spartak Moscow. When Oleg Romantsev, who was head coach of Spartak and of the Russian national team, decided to focus on the national team in 1996, Yartsev was appointed the head coach of Spartak. Spartak was rebuilding at the time, but even with many young players in the lineup, they won the league that year. They did so in a golden game which had to be played because Spartak and Alania Vladikavkaz were level on points after the championship. How much of that team success was thanks to Yartsev is still questioned, because Romantsev never really left the team and some say he continued to make all the important decisions behind the scenes. Romantsev took back his head coach position in 1997, moving Yartsev back into the assistant position.In June 1998 Yartsev was appointed the head coach of Spartak s cross-city arch-rival, Dinamo Moscow. Despite getting to the Russian Cup final in the spring of 1999, generally he didn t have much success with that team and was fired in June 1999. Before one of the Dinamo games that was played on Yartsev s birthday, Sergei Stepashin, who was the Prime Minister of Russia at the time, has given Yartsev a sabre as a birthday gift. Yartsev got another head coach position soon enough, when he joined Rotor Volgograd in January 2000. However, he couldn t do much with that team either and was fired in June of same year. For the next 3 years he was the manager of the Spartak Moscow veterans team.In August 2003, Russia was very close to elimination from their Euro 2004 preliminary qualification group and the coach Valeri Gazzayev, was fired. Most of the other high-level Russian coaches have already coached the national team at one point or another, so unexpectedly Russian soccer federation decided to put Yartsev in charge. Under Yartsev s management, Russia qualified for the playoff preliminary qualification matches, in which they beat Wales. That series ended with controversy. First Russia asked UEFA to disqualify Wales midfielder Ryan Giggs for elbowing a Russian defender in the first leg of the playoffs, which UEFA refused to do. Later key Russian midfielder Egor Titov was disqualified for testing positive for an illegal performance enhancing drug, Wales asked to be declared winners because of that, but that request was ultimately denied and their court case dismissed.In Euro 2004 Russia lost the first two games to Spain and Portugal 0-1 and 0-2 and was the first team to be eliminated. After the first game Yartsev sent home one of the most experienced Russian midfielders, Alexander Mostovoi, after Mostovoi complained to the press that Yartsev is overworking players in training sessions, so they don t have any energy left for the games. Yartsev changed lineup extensively in every game, first because some key defenders were injured and he had to play the reserves and young players, and then because of disqualifications to Roman Sharonov and Sergei Ovchinnikov, who were sent off in the first two games. In their third and final meaningless group game, Russia beat Greece 2-1. That ended up being the only Greek loss in the whole tournament as Greece eventually won it all, defeating Portugal in the finals (Russia was not very lucky in getting drawn into the same group as two eventual finalists). Yartsev was not fired despite not coming out of the group stage.After a 1-7 loss to Portugal in 2006 World Cup qualifying Yartsev amazingly kept his job, but then resigned after a 1-1 draw with Estonia.Yartsev is married, and has two daughters.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is PH Balance?
QUESTION CONTENT: ideal ph balance when fighting cancer
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3025
 pH balance is a completely bogus measure when applied to cancer.  It is used by snake-oil salesman to falsely promote whatever magic pill they are trying to sell you today. pH is simply the measure of the concentration of hydrogen (in ionic form) within a solution or system, and is the basis for designation of acidity or alkalinity.  Different parts of your body exist at naturally different levels of pH in order to achieve their respective functions. Anything below 7 on the pH scale is acid , and anything above 7 is alkali ; water (which is what you are mostly made of) has a pH of 7, which is probably where all this bogus science has its roots.Many natural remedy sites will suggest that low pH can cause cancer, which is hilarious if you use common sense to think through what they are saying...without the (very) low pH in your stomach, none of the products they are hawking could be digested! Other natural remedy sites suggest a pH HIGHER than 7 is bad, but it only takes a high school biology education to understand that a pH ABOVE 7 is essential in the blood!If you are fighting cancer, you should follow the advice of a regular doctor.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 295
PH.Potential of hydrogen.A scale usedtomeasure the reaative aciditynor alkalininity of substances.The scale runs from 0 to14.A pH of 7 is consisered neutral.Numbers below 7 denote increasing acidity and numbers abobe 7 denote increasing alkalinininy.The herb alfalfa can increase alkalinity.You want alkalinity,for good health.Check out the book Prescription For Nutrirional Healing.That is my source.

It certainly isn t for wrestling ability!While I can t label Melina ugly and if I had the choice between the two, I d go with Shelly. I m into, uh, unique girls. Shelly has that look that really grabs me... She s my favorite female wrestler currently as far as looks go. Second to her is Gail Kim, as I m a sucker for Asian girls also :) and Gail is my favorite female wrestler in the business today. It s all good.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is DNA?
QUESTION CONTENT: what is it? why are they important?what does it look like?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2789
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions specifying the biological development of all cellular forms of life (and most viruses). DNA is a long polymer of nucleotides and encodes the sequence of the amino acid residues in proteins using the genetic code, a triplet code of nucleotides.In complex cells (eukaryotes), such as those from plants, animals, fungi and protists, most of the DNA is located in the cell nucleus. By contrast, in simpler cells called prokaryotes (the eubacteria and archaea), DNA is not separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear envelope. The cellular organelles known as chloroplasts and mitochondria also carry DNA.DNA is important because it is the molecule of heredity as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. These traits can range from hair colour to disease susceptibility. During cell division, DNA is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction. Lineage studies can be done based on the facts that the DNA in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA) only comes from the mother, and the male Y chromosome only comes from the father.It looks like an helix.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 530
 A nucleic acid that carries the genetic information in the cell and is capable of self-replication and synthesis of RNA. DNA consists of two long chains of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and joined by hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases adenine and thymine or cytosine and guanine. The sequence of nucleotides determines individual hereditary characteristics ETYMOLOGY: d(eoxyribo)n(ucleic) a(cid)

Diabetes mellitus is a medical disorder characterized by varying or persistent hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar levels), especially after eating. All types of diabetes mellitus share similar symptoms and complications at advanced stages. Hyperglycemia itself can lead to dehydration and ketoacidosis. Longer-term complications include cardiovascular disease (doubled risk), chronic renal failure (it is the main cause for dialysis), retinal damage which can lead to blindness, nerve damage which can lead to erectile dysfunction (impotence), gangrene with risk of amputation of toes, feet, and even legs. The more serious complications are more common in people who have a difficult time controlling their blood sugars with medications (glycemic control).The most important forms of diabetes are due to decreased or the complete absence of the production of insulin (type 1 diabetes), or decreased sensitivity of body tissues to insulin (type 2 diabetes, the more common form). The former requires insulin injections for survival, while the latter is generally managed with diet, weight reduction and exercise in about 20% of cases,the majority require these strategies plus oral medication and insulin is used if the tablets are ineffective.Treatments which return the blood sugar to normal levels can reduce or prevent development of the complications of diabetes. Other health problems that accelerate the damaging effects of diabetes are smoking, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of regular exercise.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Posthumanism?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2779
In literary and critical theory, posthumanism, meaning beyond humanism, is a European emergent philosophy and is the dominant secular, rational humanist philosophy. It transcends the ideas and images of the world of classical Renaissance humanism to correspond more closely to the 21st century s ideas of scientific knowledge. It mainly differentiates from classical humanism in that it restores the stature that had been made of humanity to one of many natural species. According to this claim, humans have no inherent rights to destroy nature or set themselves above it in ethical considerations a priori.Human knowledge is also reduced to a less controlling position, previously seen as the defining aspect of the world. The limitations and fallibility of human intelligence are confessed, even though that doesn t mean abandoning the strong rational tradition of humanism

I love LOTR, the book is probably the most difficult I have ever read and I have only read it ONCE. As I was going through, I had a lot of resources to help me keep the story straight and get background info on things. Mainly I had trouble during the landscape descriptive parts and me with my ADD...telling down to the shadow on the last PEBBLE bless him, I guess if I had created a whole world, I would want you to know what it looked like, too!However, I did fall in love with this story, even if I did have to wade through the setting. The depth of each and every character is staggering, and the plot is so exciting...and I did enjoy the book for its complete telling of the story unlike the movie which left some really cool parts out. Tom Bombadil? The ruination of the Shire? The aftermath of the attack on Gondor?I also loved the movies, why? Beefcake, of course! Aragorn is hot when he is all dirty and plowing through orcs and 20 foot doors and swinging around his sword. And I don t even really enjoy Viggo Mortenson that much in anything else. And I love what they did with Hobbiton. And the setting that I had so much trouble reading? Well, it s just laid out there to see for yourself.

Is it Coumarin? It is anticoagulant or the medicine to prevent or retard formation of clot.

I take coumadin for my heart.  It is to thin the blood and flow easier.  Helps to avoid blockages and clots.It is warfin, same as in rat poison, but it is too strong for them, they are small.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1487
Y4 is right. It was invented in the 1948 and was used as a  rat poison in 1952. It was approved for medical use in 1954.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1488
Warfarin, which goes by the brand name Coumadin, is an anticoagulant (a substance that prevents the clotting of blood)medication. This means that it helps prevent clots from forming in the blood. Blood thinners are used to treat some types of heart disease.Blood clots can move to other parts of your body and cause serious medical problems, such as a heart attack. Warfarin will not dissolve a blood clot; however, over time, the blood clot may dissolve on its own. Warfarin may also prevent other clots from forming or prevent clots from becoming larger. Warfarin will not dissolve a blood clot, but it may prevent other clots from forming and keep existing clots from getting larger.I have been on Coumadin for 4 years and will be for the rest of my life.  The reason is because I had my mitral valve replaced with a mechanical valve.  Click below link for more info:http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/warfarin-other-blood-thinners?page=2

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2638
my experience during grad school was great.  first of all i noticed a huge difference in the treatment from the professors. they treatyou as if you were one of them. this is due to the fact that they know that unlike undergrads you are actually there because you care and want to learn.  this causes them, at least in my experience, to do away with all the busy work and strict deadlines for turning stuff in.  all my professors seemed very lenient and very willing to help in any way possible. this was my experience in the Spanish Linguistics department at Arizona State University

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2762
DNA The molecule that carries genetic information in all living systems (see genetic code). The DNA molecule is formed in the shape of a double helix from a great number of smaller molecules (see nucleotides). The workings of the DNA molecule provide the most fundamental explanation of the laws of genetics.DNA acts in three important way. First, when a cell divides, the DNA uncoils, and each strand creates a new partner from the surrounding material ??? a process called replication. The two cells that result from the cell division have the same DNA as the original (see mitosis). Second, in sexual reproduction, each parent contributes one of the two strands in the DNA of the offspring. Third, inside the cell, the DNA governs the production of proteins and other molecules essential to cell function. medical:Deoxyribonucleic acid; a nucleic acid that consists of two long chains of nucleotides twisted together into a double helix and joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases adenine and thymine or cytosine and guanine; it carries the cell s genetic information and hereditary characteristics via its nucleotides and their sequence and is capable of self-replication and RNA synthesis.

QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2863
Shakespeare presents - as always (excepting the tedious Comedy of Errors ) characters with many sides. The interpretation is yours. You should go away from these plays (especially good productions) or texts having been filled with ideas and questions. WS does not give neat closed characters but ones with many facets and many ways of being played. I suggest that you approach R&J from the perspective of it definitely NOT being romantic (which, of course, it isn t but since the 18th century it has had this banner over its head which has misguided so many). And, conversely, approach the Shrew as a Romantic tale. You wil get more out of them that way. First of course you need to read them once or twice to be familiar enough with the general story.There are no shortcuts with Shakespeare but all effort is rewarded!

No matter how much the owner of the team takes advantage of the fans with a cruddy product and overpriced tickets, their city loves them. No matter how many years go by without them even getting a sniff of the Cup, their city loves them. So, essentially, they don t need me to like them. I admire the loyalty of their fans, but I hate the team. Being a Red Wings fan, it used to be the Avalanche. Now the Avs are too pathetic to hate. I feel sorry for them instead, though that Stastny kid is pretty good. Maybe they ll be a worthy rival again someday.

TIMI stands for Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction TIMI Grade Flow is a widely adopted scoring system from 0-3 referring to levels of coronary blood flow assessed during percutaneous coronary angioplasty:1.  TIMI 0 flow (no perfusion) refers to the absence of any antegrade flow beyond a coronary occlusion. 2.  TIMI 1 flow (penetration without perfusion) is faint antegrade coronary flow beyond the occlusion, with incomplete filling of the distal coronary bed. 3.  TIMI 2 flow (partial reperfusion) is delayed or sluggish antegrade flow with complete filling of the distal territory. 4.  TIMI 3 flow (complete perfusion) is normal flow which fills the distal coronary bed completely Click these links if you would like more info:http://www.americanheartassociation.com/presenter.jhtml?identifier=10000015&filter=p&q=timi&btnG=Search&summaries=1&output=xml_no_dtd&sort=date%3AD%3AL%3Ad1&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&num=10http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMIhttp://www.reference.com/search?q=timi%20score&r=d&db=web

I assume you are referring to white light which is a mixture of different wavelength energy waves. The physical nature of light can be only explained through the concept of wave-particle duality. Some phenomena require explanation by considering light as a wave whilst others require light to be considered as a particle.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 134
Light is electromagnetic radiation.Varying magnetic fields induce electric fields, and varying electric fields induce magnetic fields.  If a source of magnetic or electric energy oscillates, the result is a sinusoidal wave.  Since the rate of change of a sinusoidal function is another sinusoidal function the effect is that induced electric and magnetic fields are able to serve as their own medium.  Thus, unlike other waves that are traveling disturbances through a medium, electromagnetic waves can travel through space.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is your opinion about men crying?
QUESTION CONTENT: what do you feel and think when you see a men crying,and what if he is crying with womens around him.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 1363
I think it s beautiful when a man cries. When a man is willing to be sensitive and show his vulnerability. It melts my heart. It s very rare. Most men won t show their emotions this way. They re too afraid of seeming weak. They hide their feelings behind a tough veneer. Many of them don t seem like they feel anything. It s frustrating.I only knew one man in my life who was extremely sensitive. He cried often. He had a lot of tragedy in his life (losing both his parents etc). He was a very artistic soul. He loved nature. He would cry if something was beautiful (like the sunrise in Algonquin). He was an extraordinary person. I adored him. Unfortunately he hated himself. He always felt like he was weak. He hated his emotions. He tried to drown them with alcohol. He was an alcoholic&ended up dying in a drinking binge. It was a tragedy we all saw coming but no one could save him from himself. He turned to alcohol to numb the pain&sorrow of life. If only he could have seen what a remarkable person he was&how beautiful life could be...Crying is a great release. I cry in sorrow&I weep for joy. I can t imagine if I had to hold it in or wasn t allowed to do it.If only men could be in tune with their feelings without feeling like less of a man. If only a man could be both strong&sensitive. Could allow himself to cry but not see it as a fault&hate himself for it. Perhaps some can, but they re the exception not the rule. I am glad that I m a woman&allowed to feel my feelings.I blame socialization. When they re hurt, sad, scared, often little girls are told there there it s ok. They are protected&coddled when they cry. Little boys are told not to cry, to toughen up&deal with it. They grow into men who won t dare show their feelings.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1366
There is a societal delusion that more or less states that it is inappropriate for men to show emotions, especially crying. In my experience, crying can be a cleansing of sorts, and can also be an expression of being deeply touched by something. i do a good deal of public speaking and there is a particularly poignant part of my presentation where i become very emotionally moved due to the fact that i had a deeply impactive spiritual awakening that moved me to the depth of my soul; and every time i share about it i still show this emotional intimacy because i am unable to stop it, and , to be honest, i DON T want to stop it. It is a part of what makes me the man i have become and i will not deny any part of me.And i am not particular who i show this tender side of myself to either. Besides, i am 5 10 and weigh 250, so i don t get many people who say anything derrogatory about it, and if they do, it s their own shortcoming to deny  part of who they are.

I cried when my son was born, I cried when my grandfather died, I cried when my ex and I seperated (mind you - not in front of her). It s not that we cry, its when we cry and how we hold back our emotions when our emotional strength is needed to comfort someone else. Being able to let myself cry when I need to makes me a better person.I ve also punched holes in the wall. Of the two actions the second seems a lot less adult, a lot less in control, a lot less manly .Seeing men cry for me is the same as see women cry... as long as it seems sincere and not over the top, it s perfectly fine.

crying is such a release, and in my opinion tears can never compromise someones strength weather a man or a woman.don t worry about it, cry all you want just be yourself.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2475
I once read somewhere that women cry more than men because we are more emotionally attuned, and therefore are more conscious of the depth of the sadness and the happiness in the world- that is why we re more deeply touched by things.I don t know whether or not that s true, but I don t think any less of a man for crying sometimes. I think it s immature if someone is crying for a stupid reason (like because they don t get their way), but that is stupid whether it s a woman or a man. Conversely, I actually think less of a man who says he never cries, because he s either lying or very hard-hearted. I don t cry much myself, but everyone has to do it once in a while.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is TNT?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2911
a pale yellow, solid organic nitrogen compound used chiefly as an explosive, prepared by stepwise nitration of toluene. Because TNT melts at 82?? C (178?? F) and does not explode below 240?? C (464?? F), it can be melted in steam-heated vessels and poured into casings. It is relatively insensitive to shock and cannot be exploded without a detonator. For these reasons it is the most favoured chemical explosive, extensively used in munitions and for demolitions.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 3056
TNT is short for TriNitroToluene which by the way is a very good for explosions.  It turns out that TNT molecules are actually very large with a rather weak structure which means that even just a little bit of jumbling/shaking the molecules can break apart.  The good part is that the process of TNT molecules breaking apart is exothermic, meaning it releases energy, and it releases a lot of energy which makes a a very loud boom.  That is why great care is taken when transporting TNT because if you are carrying a truck full of TNT and you are going on a bumpy road, you might not make it back alive.TNT has obviously been immortalized by Warner Brother s Looney Toons, in particular when Wile E. Coyote has tried soooooo hard to get the Road Runner.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 3057
Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is an explosive. TNT was first synthesised by Joseph Wilbrand in the year 1863, and the first large-scale production began in Germany in 1891.The explosive yield of TNT is considered the standard measure of strength of bombs and other explosives

A creature with two y chromosomes would have two fathers and no mother.How would it be created - from two sperm and no ovum?  And how would it gestate?If some genetic aberration would created using some specially designed artificial womb and futuristic gene substitution techniques and a YY creature was hypothetically created then it would have many freakish genetic abnormalities and be hideously deformed.  Hormone levels would be regulated in a way as to make the creature develop in a unique way, probably causing abnormal proportions and metabolism.The chances of YY creature surviving long enough to be born would be statistically almost impossible.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1465
that cant be done. if you re female (XX) you get an X chromosome from your mother, and an X chromosome off your father.if you re male (Xy) then you get the X chromosome off your mother and the y chromosome off your father. in order to be yy then that would mean you got both genes off your father. 2 sperm + 0 egg = no babyif that could possibly happen then males would be giving birth to their own mini-me s :-)

I did manage to get my problems under control through behavioral modification.What I did was to get a timer.  I started with five minutes, and would work for five minutes on something then move on to something else or reward myself.You really have to know how to reward your child as well.

Genealogy the study and tracing of family pedigrees. This involves collecting the names of relatives, both living and deceased, and establishing the relationships between them based on primary, secondary and/or circumstantial evidence or documentation, thus building up a cohesive family tree. Genealogy is sometimes also referred to as family history, although these terms may be used distinctly: the former being the basic study of who is related to whom; the latter involving more fleshing out of the life and family histories of the individuals involved. One way to find the family lineage is with the use of the genealogical method. It is a well-established ethnographic technique. The early ethnographers developed symbols that covered the issue of kinship, descent, and marriage. Studying one s genealogy is important in terms of social organization, especially where people live and work with their kin everyday. It plays a very important role in understanding the current socialrelations and reconstructing the history. Marriage is also looked at because it is important in creating alliances amongst tribes, clans and villages.

It is a hobby, like stamp collecting or trout fishing with dry flies. Most of us who practise it look for our ancestors, back as far as we can go. Some genealogists try to trace all of the descendants of a specific person; often, in the US, the first person with a surname to come to the US.Those of us who like it find it a fascinating hobby. People who don t think we are odd. However, I know people who catch perfectly good fish and release them instead of eating them. They are happy doing so, and don t care if the rest of us think they are odd.Genealogy has boomed with the advent of the Internet, for two reasons. First, a Genealogy collection is nothing but data. If I trade you 300 individuals - names, dates, spouse s names, short biographies - for 150 of yours, both of our collections are now bigger. That would not be the case if we both collected stamps, baseball cards or souvineer spoons. (There are ways to trade dead relatives by e-mail, called GEDCOM files. They let you import individuals at roughly 500 per second.)Second, one can find data almost instantly on the Internet. Before the Internet, if you wanted to look at an 1850 census for Monroe County, VA, you d have to send away for it on microfilm through a library, wait, then read the microfilm at the library. Now, with a subscription to any of the on-line census services, you can look the data up almost instantly, from the comfort of your home.

the second one,it actually looks better and you notice what it really is right away but more enhanced
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2432
The second one. The effects you added are less glaring, and retain more of the form of what you show. If you want to add lines, break images, shift effects, then you should try to have some point to it. For instance, Mondrian had a point. I get it, so I find I do not need to see more of his work, but there was at least one idea there.Your first picture is just an artifact, no ideas.

i couldnt pull up the second, the first one was kinda cool. i would say depends on the photo or scenery its used on.

I like the second one because the effect is more subtle and naturalistic looking. Very pretty.

I ve never seen her dance badly and I m so jealous of her! That s not my main gift but I think if I were able to devote more time to it I could be really good.

I did danceline in middle school, and I also did ballet for a couple of years when I was younger and clogged for a few years, too. I hope I get a chance to do some dancing in college.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 164
Pride and Prejudice is much more enjoyable for me. I hated the ending of R and J. I got tired of everything going wrong and turning out so horrible. I saw the movie for the original R/J when I was 14 and I cried so hard and so long that I got a migraine headache!  That s just wrong!  (I guess I got into it too much)!They are both good stories and really you can t easily compare them because they are about two different sets of people at two different time periods. Really young and foolish lovers and then older, saner people who weren t quite so foolish!

The Shakespearean tragedy .
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 165
I much prefer Pride and Prejudice because I prefer comedy to tragedy, and i love the characters and dialogue in P and P. And Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most attractive heroines ever created.   Romeo and Juliet is not a play I would ever choose to go and see, as I do not much care for the story.  However, I did think the film with Leonardo di Capprio was very well done.  I am more partial to Shakespeare s comedies myself.  If you want a more cheerful play of his, try Much Ado About Nothing (there is a very good film version with Kenneth Brannagh and Emma Thompson). As You Like It  Twelfth Night and the Merry Wives of Windsor are also good comedies, but there are no outstanding film or TV versions of those that I can think of.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Rieke?
QUESTION CONTENT: Energy?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2633
It is spelled Reiki and pertains to the use of energy to heal the body. Reiki is a form of Japanese spiritual healing.  This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on reiki energy channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body s molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  A treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body s energy centers or chakras. Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated. To get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T ai Chi. You can find classes at the YMCA or, sometimes, through the  adulteducation programs in American cities.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Cancer?
QUESTION CONTENT: Development of cancer, Types of treatment, effects of cancer
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2699
Cancer is a disease of cells. It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). Cancer is also called malignancy. A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor. A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign. Benign tumors are not cancer. Cancer is not one disease. It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases. Cancer is NOT contagious.Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area. Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start. If a cancer spreads (metastasizes), the new tumor bears the same name as the original(primary) tumor. The frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender. While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women, the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women, breast cancer. Cancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality. Skin cancers are often curable. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today.Cancer is the Latin word for crab. The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy, doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades. Cancer may also be called malignancy, a malignant tumor, or a neoplasm (literally, a new growth).TreatmentDevelopments in the treatment of cancer have led to greatly improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients in the past three decades. Traditionally, cancer has been treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In recent years immunotherapy has been added to that list. New drugs and techniques are constantly being researched and developed, such as antiangiogenic agents (e.g., angiostatin and endostatin), genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies, retinoid agents, and vaccine agents (stimulating the immune system).
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 522
A Zodiac sign ;)is a disease
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 818
Cancer occurs when cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. Normal cells divide and grow in an orderly fashion, but cancer cells do not. They continue to grow and crowd out normal cells. Although there are many kinds of cancer, they all have in common this out-of-control growth of cells. Different kinds of cancer can behave very differently. For example, lung cancer and breast cancer are very different diseases. They grow at different rates and respond to different treatments. That s why people with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their kind of cancer.Even when cancer has spread to a new place in the body, it is still named after the part of the body where it started. For example, if prostate cancer spreads to the bones, it is still called prostate cancer. If breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it is still breast cancer. When cancer comes back in a person who appeared to be free of the disease after treatment, it is called a recurrence.

To be cold blooded means to be emotionless. A cold blooded killer, for example, feels no remorse for his actions. So the answer to your question is no, it doesn t represent hatred, because hatred is an emotion and the person who is cold blooded doesn t feel emotions.

The Diamond in the Window by Jane Langton is a nice fantasy and a good introduction to the Transcendentalists.  All books by Margot Benary-Isbert are good.

I respect what you have to say, and I respect the emotion that you feel.My advice would be to start looking at how you rhyme. Developing different rhytmes than go/show, time/mime, me/see is important. As one of the other answerers said, I felt like I knew what each of your rhymes were going to be before I read them.It s kind ve like that band Kittie - the first time I heard that album from them I was counting along to it, saying okay, the rhythm is chug chug chug-chug chug-chug and the breakdown happens.... here... and then there s going to be a quieter part ... here ... and .... It sucked. I really wanted to adore them (metal chicks! yeah!) but it was derivative - and I was bored.Now, that s an aside, and I m not saying that you bore me or anything like that. What I m saying is that there are a lot of other ways to rhyme than perfect vowel rhymes. Google imperfect rhymes , for instance. Most music stores will have a songwriters rhyming dictionary. Those are pretty sweet learning tools.My lead singer actually keeps a three inch thick dictionary near him whenever he writes, he ll start opening it at random and trying to find words that are unusual but fit. It s not easy - I still think his use of sui generis, ahh me! was one of his less memorable lines, but it s a hit or miss thing.I wish you good luck, keep writing!Saul
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2194
yeah, I think it s pretty good. You could change some of the wording if you wanted, and it s a little cheesy at the end - nothing a few edits can t fix!Great job and keep on writing!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2195
I feel like you can tighten the stanzas a bit... Some lines are too wordy and slow down the flow. Consider adding contractions instead of would have make it would ve Maybe something like.... All the times we spent together; the memories will last/Somehow I fell for you, knowing it was a thing of the past/You promised you would never leave and always be here./When I looked into your eyes, I never thought of fear. I love the line I went for the dance , very unique phrase and it works well. mime feels like you forced it to rhyme with time, although you did make it flow well in that line... Mime is just such an odd word! Lol.Last stanza isn t as strong as your other ones... Maybe do some repetition of your first one, and then change it to how now he s with her?Or I gave you my all, I didn t know where to go/Then I find out, to you I was nothing but a show./I only lasted for so long, and you went to her/I still care for you and wish the best, but all you ll see is anger/ I don t know... play around a bit, try to cut out a few words.... Overall I really like it, keep writing!  Thanks for sharing :)

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2657
.Mysticism teaches us that the human form is the microcosm wherein this entire macrocosm maybe found. The human form contains the soul --- a drop of that Divine Ocean which is God. Each drop has the potential to return to the Lord --- yet it is a matter to be EXPERIENCED and not INTELLECTUALIZEDWHO IS GOD AND WHAT DOES HE REALLY WANT FROM US?Before we define God, it is necessary to understand some of the limitations we have to face when discussing such a grand subject. Our Mind is a finite entity. This means it has its limitations. It had a beginning and an end. It can do so much, and then can do no more. For example, we can multiply figures mentally to a certain extent; we can hear sounds in specific frequency ranges; we cannot perceive the presence of X Rays; we cannot tune in our senses to the radio waves from the local broadcasting services. This brings us to an important principle of life which applies equally to mysticism---- THERE ARE THINGS WHICH EXIST THAT CANNOT BE PERCEIVED BY THE SENSES. The greatest drawback is ---- How can the mind understand something which is greater than itself? How can a finite entity comprehend something Infinite like God? And just as man can understand the above with the help of certain tools, man CAN come to know GOD through certain methodsWe shall try to discuss God with our limited mind and try to get a tiny glimpse of Him.God has certain attributes. We are told that He is comprised of1--- Omniscience2--- Omnipresence3--- Omnipotence4--- LoveSince He has created everything, He is the Creator of Knowledge itself. It also means that there is nothing unknown to God. God is therefore the Supreme Power of Consciousness. God is present in every particle of the creation, for He would need to be everywhere in order to know everything. If God is everywhere in His creation, it is obvious that He also resides within every one of us, for are we not a part of the creation? We take up space and exist, so an Omnipresent God must be present within all of us. The Lord is the Ultimate Power and since he is the Ultimate Power, His ‘will’, must ultimately prevail in all matters. From His vantage point, there can be no activity taking place in the creation without His sanction. As the Ultimate Power, He must be in contact of the creationAnother quality of Omnipotence is ‘Free Will’. Certainly an All Powerful Force can do anything it wishes. (To put it in other words, free will increases as consciousness is elevated. The higher up in consciousness we go, the more free will is in operation).On the human level, free will is conditioned and limited by our circumstances and our actions. Divine Love is different to Human Love. When we love someone, he must somehow meet our needs and desires and thus becomes part of the reason we are moved to love him. Human love is conditional and imperfect. In human love we attempt to merge with the beloved but at best, it brings us emotionally closer to one another. We cannot give up our own individuality and way of thinking, which is necessary to become truly One with another.In Divine Love, individuality ceases and one becomes united with the Lord and the entire creation. The Divine Lover, having merged himself into the Ocean of God, sees Divinity pervading every creature. If we really understood His Plan, then anyone who becomes One with God must experience this Divine love, or CESSATION OF ALL DUALITY. When we rely upon our mind, we are utilizing a highly subjective instrument. This tendency of mind to pick and choose, accept and reject, renders it difficult to be an objective observer. The mind is also made of filters, bypasses, mazes and baffles. These constitute our values, prejudices, point of view, etc. In order for an outside stimulus to reach our inner awareness, it must first successfully work its way through this complicated maze. Perhaps the stimulus, such as a new idea, may be repugnant to our value system. In such a case, it encounters resistance. The mind plays tricks. The mind will gladly cooperate in justifying its decisions by assembling supporting facts. We must be, therefore, careful, in the pursuit of Spiritual Truth, to be aware of the mind’s limitations and blocksINNER MYSTIC TRUTH CANNOT BE PERCEIVED THROUGH INTELLECTUAL PREJUDICE. ONLY AN UNBIASED MIND IS CAPABLE OF PERCEIVING TRUTHMan has been programmed by God to seek 1--- Infinite Existence2--- Infinite Knowledge or Awareness3--- Infinite BlissEveryone is frightened of Death. We wonder what is beyond the door of Death. Man is obsessed with immortality. He has built his culture around a response to this fear. Memorials of himself abound everywhere to dampen his fear of oblivion…. The Pyramids of Pharaohs of Egypt are an example of man’s hope of an afterlife. Man is a curious and conscious creature. Would anyone wish to live 300 years in coma? There is no virtue in existence without awareness. Science itself is based upon the premise of curiosity. Yet, with all this new-found knowledge, are we content? No. we continually launch new projects. Not content with the mysteries of this planet, we have begun inter-planetary exploration. Man desires infinite knowledge or awareness. He can be content only if he knows everything.But what would be the purpose of knowing everything and existing eternally if that existence were unbearable or insufferable? It is clear that we all desire Love, Bliss, Peace or HappinessMan truly desires God, for only by becoming one with Him, can we fulfil these conditions. Only the Infinite can give of the Infinite; only the Omniscient can give us knowledgeThe moving away from negative and unrewarding experiences, we are automatically moving towards positive experiences, whether we realise it or notThis world is designed to be a training ground for the soulFirst stageA human being tries to indulge in sensual pleasures to find his happiness. The world of the five senses is a fascinating one, there is so much to see, do and experience. But sensual pleasures do not provide man with “perpetual or constant” pleasure. There is something ephemeral about them. He begins to avoid them gradually.Second stageThe next evolutionary step for us is to move into the sphere of worldly attainments. Wealth, name, fame and positions of power begin to take priority. Here again, he finds disappointment. Look at the people who are applauded by the masses. Today they are public heroes, tomorrow, the object of ridicule and scorn. An ex prime minister becomes a virtual nobody when he leaves office. A rich man finds that he is now obsessed with safeguarding his wealth. He begins to suspect the motives of his close contacts. He finds his friends vanish when disaster strikes. He finds no peace with what he has and finds that he wants even more. Wealth, Power, Position and Fame never fill our needs because they are transitory and fleetingThird stageMan concludes that a life of selfless service is the answer. He places his talents at the disposal of mankind. By such altruistic service, he hopes to get an uplifting effect upon his inner being. And therefore, the world has no dearth of noble philanthropists. This 3rd phase represents a significant improvement. We are less self-centred. This comes closer to True Love where we are actively concerned about the well being of others over ourselves. But here, too, eventually, despair sets in, for a slowly dawning consciousness decrees that our efforts are having but little effect on the world. For every good deed we do, another person is performing an evil one. We find we are sweeping the world clean, while others are constantly dumping additional garbage on the newly swept ground. No one has ever succeeded in changing the nature of the world. The world seems bent upon following its prescribed course despite all our efforts. The philanthropist also finds that the masses often turn on him, as in the case of Gandhi. When Christ spoke to the general masses regarding good moral conduct, He was accused of trying to set up some kind of kingdom for himself.Fourth stageThe ultimate conclusion which we reach is that the world is designed to operate in DUALITY. Every quality we can name or identify has its opposite attribute. There is good and evil, virtue and sin, honour and dishonour, day and night, riches and poverty, male and female, birth and death. For evil person there seems to be a good one and for every catastrophe which takes place, good works soon follow. In short, the world seems programmed to operate in this given duality, and despite the efforts of the noblest of men, we have not eliminated war, poverty, suffering or prejudice. Evidently the Lord wants us to rise above this world of Duality and Opposites. Only then can the soul find Liberation from Bondage. Man realises that the world is a restriction, so are the body and mind. Man sees the necessity of turning from the finite to the infinite. The fourth and final stage has been reachedWHY DOES GOD HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES?WHY DO PEOPLE FIGHT FOR &#039;ALLAH&#039;, &#039;RAM&#039;, &#039;JESUS&#039;, ETC.?If God has made this entire creation, He can only be an impartial Power. He has sent many Enlightened Souls from Him to the world. Some of these souls were Jesus, Allah and Ram. Such souls were and are spread into the entire world. Many religions were started in their name although their main purpose was only to help man to find God. We give so many names to God out of Love and Adoration. And of course, different languages and different languages have different names for God. These different names have been misunderstood by many to believe that there are as many Gods as there are religions…. Their God being the True One and other religions having the False GodCAN CONSCIENCE BE GOD HIMSELF?Conscience is the moral compass placed by God by which man can ultimately reach Him. Man is either moving towards or away from God on this moral compass. Man reads holy books to seek God…. He abides by the rules and instructions given in these holy books and thus purifies and cleanses his self. The purer the soul the higher is his state of Consciousness or AwarenessIF YES, HOW DO I TALK TO HIM? WILL HE ANSWER?I know of ONLY ONE WAY----- MEDITATION----- YES HE DOES ANSWER----provided that man has reached a high level of purification and innocenceThere may be other ways of talking to God….the possibilities are there but this has worked for meAlso read my answer inDefining and identifying Godhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

Where God is an ocean, human soul is a drop of water.God creates, and so does human.  My creation is like a drop of water allowing life to micro cells, and having in common with ocean (God), the ability to generate objects and life forms. He does his stuff, and I do mine; hoping I can grow to a bigger drop, spring, stream, river, sea and ocean.  Even though I m a drop, I can feel the ocean sometimes.God, the heaviest possible being, decided to share himself, and the universe was born.The opposite of God is not Evil, it is not-sharing. The opposite of Evil is justice. God is good at sharing, Evil is good at injustice.  God encompasses matter as well as concepts; Evil encompasses concepts only, and lacks matter.  Evil is inferior to God.But let me ask you:Is concept as real as matter?Is mountain as real as a stone?Is ocean as real as a drop of water?Is God as real as all beings?Yes!

God isYaweh or Jehovah are common vocalizations of God s personal name based on the Hebrew tetragrammaton (above). Most modern Christian Bibles have removed this name in nearly all of the 7000 places it appears in the Hebrew Scriptures, usually replacing it with LORD or a similar alternative. The name does appear at four places in the King James Bible (e.g. Exodus 6:3), but is only used with prominence by the Jehovah s Witnesses. Nearly all Christian traditions recognize the name in some form, even if it has largely fallen out of use.Jesus (Yeshua`, Yesh??` or Yehosh??a`) is a Hebraic personal name meaning Jehovah Saves , and Christ means the anointed in Greek. (translating Messiah). Much of Christendom believes in a divine Trinity, i.e. a single God manifest in God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.

You have asked a bunch of various questions about different types of surgeons in an attempt to decide your long term career path. Here is a tip for you. See if you can get into med school first and then while you are working in med school you can see your various surgical options first hand and have a much better idea of what type surgeon you might or might not want to be. Surgical training is a decision made in during your last years of med school  - not before you even get into med school. You have to finish med school before you even have the opportunity to start thinking about making the type of decisions that you are asking about. Med school experience would be a much better source of real life answers to your questions than asking people on Yahoo answers.

Well, I don t HATE any drivers, but I strongly dislike Jeff.1. When he wrecks someone, intentionally or not, he never admits that it was his fault. 2. He whines if someone bumps or wrecks him, but he does the same thing and thinks he didn t do anything wrong. It s ok for him to do it to someone else, but not ok for it to happen to him.3. He complains that people race him too hard. Last week it was the non-chasers who wouldn t get out of his way, two weeks ago it was Brian Vickers, and he complained about Jimmie racing him too hard a little while ago. He expects everyone to just let him by. 4. he s a prima-donnaOh, and NO!!!! He is not sexy at all. He looks like a weasel or something.And to the people who think it s because I m jealous, I m not.

Here we go.Another GQ fan that wants to talk racing. No I am not a Jeff Gordon fan,anymore.When he raced the BUSCH series I thought that he was the best.He piloted that #1 BABY RUTH ford and was a really good driver.Today he is one ont the 25 best drivers in NASCAR history.Then as for looks he is in the top 10.But his history leaves something to be. 1)Gordon had a contract with Ford to race in cup.But suddenly there was a law suit and Gordon s contract with this ford team is suddenly void. 2) With in a week Gordon is signed with Hendricks racing. 3) His rookie year was really good on the track,but personality off the track was something that needed some work. This event happened at an auto graph session that even Gordon would have approved if asked.( A man with his son ,the son looked about 5 or 6.The event sign stated the first 500 would get an autograph.When the man got there the event worker pulled a gate over seperating the man from his son.This man argued that his son was to go with him but the event worker,in a Hendricks Racing shirt, said they had a counter at the table and if more than 500 people comes thru he would lose his job.Not only this man argued but several of us argued this fact that you don t seperate a father and son.I got out of line and gave the boy my spot. I inquired about this to Hendricks and was told that when the table counter reached 500 Gordon would leave,so if the boy had got in line he would not get an autograph.This was their policy for all of their drivers. I ve been to races where Rusty Wallace and Sterlin Marlin stayed at the track for over 3 hours signing wntil everyone got one.So this made me see that Gordon was not a fan person. 4)Gordon is the biggest whinner in NASCAR.If he bumps someone it was just racing .But if some one bumps him the other driver did it on purpose and Gordon whines to NASCAR and the first microphone he comes to. I say this for I think that you missy are not a race fan but a groupie or soccer mom .I have followed NASCAR since 1960 and have see beeter drivers and worst drivers.So what your saying is from a person that does not know what racing is,.When the green flag drops on raceday the best 43 drivers race. And as for jail,I think you had best learn that racing is a sport and not a QC fasion show.

QUESTION SUBJECT: paintballers only. what is the dwell on a paintball? what is ROF ?  Psp fire mode? Milenium fire mode?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 121
dwell is just a function for the solenoid.  If you dont understand this function it is best to leave it as it is, if you mess it up your gun wont shoot.  First you need to understand how a solenoid works.  On a solenoid there are 3 hoses that go into it.  One hose supplies the solenoid with air, the other two are for controlling the bolt/ram depending on what kind of gun you have.  At any point in time one of those hoses will be pressurized and one will not.  When you pull the trigger, the board tells the solenoid to swap basically, if hose 1 was pressurized and hose 2 unpressurized, now hose 2 is pressurzied and hose 1 is unpressurized.  The dwell is how long the solenoid keeps this swapped, in milliseconds.  Once that time has been reached, it reverts back to its original state with hose 1 pressurized and hose 2 unpressurized.  ROF is rate of fire.  On a board/instruction manual the ROF CAP is the maximum the board will allow you to shoot, in balls per second.  If your fingers are slow you may never reach the max ROF.  PSP and Millenium Fire modes, are ramping modes.  PSP is a series here in the united states and Millenium is aseries over in europe.  They each have different allowable modes like 3 shot burst, full auto, ramp.. and also ROF caps.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is Bells Palsy?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2619
Bell s Palsy results from inflammation of the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve), which innervates the muscles of the face.  It is not, however, responsible for feeling in your skin; this is done by the 5th cranial nerve.The result of this is that muscles on the affected side of the face go limp, and you look like someone suffering from a stroke.This inflammation is often caused by a viral infection and is treated with antiinflammatories until the infection is gone.  Bell s Palsy is only temporary the majority of the time, but it can result in long lasting effects.  I once dated a girl who suffered from Bell s Plasy a few years earlier, and she still had very minor symptoms of it in some muscles around the eye.  There were not easily visible unless you looked for them, though.

QUESTION CONTENT: I need to kno!!!!! I havent gonnaen the 4th book yet and i must kno!! its eating away at me!!!! cuz i just found out that hanna died and spencer killed ali! So who s A???
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 117
No one knows, the fourth book (when it s revealed) doesn t come out until May 1st, 2008.  My advice, reread the first 3 books and look for clues specifically about his or her identity.  Authors tend to put in stuff that, when you look back, makes you go OH!  How did I miss that?!?! You can probably find out on your own.  Check for character quirks and see if anything in A s personality matches anything in the other characters.  Look for who has a connection to everyone involved.  In response to other peoples posts, the author herself said there are only 4 books, and Unbelievable is the fourth and final, and it has the reveal of the identity of A, so watch out for what people post.  A lot of it is just old cut and paste news that is since outdated.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Moleskine?  If its just a brand of notebooks, where did the word originate from?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2672
I can t be definitive about this, but -- to the best of my knowledge, moleskines are notebook made by a particular company, which has been during so for over 200 years.  The notebooks are notable for their durability, and have been used by many famous writers, artists and travellers, from Hemingway to Van Gogh to Bruce Chatwin.I m sure the word originated from moleskin which meant a heavy durable cotton fabric -- a little like denim.  Clothes made of moleskin were common in the seventeenth or eighteenth century.  (Sorry about the lack of precision.)  One side of the fabric had a brushed nap, which I suppose reminded people of the skin of a mole.  It was not actually made of mole skin.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is  Hypertropic Heart Disease?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2589
Hypertropic heart disease means increase in the size of heart(due to increase number of cells microscopically) due to over stressed muscles e.g. long standing hypertension.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A genetic disorder of the heart characterized by increased thickness (hypertrophy) of the wall of the left ventricle, the largest of the four chambers of the heart. The disease can present at any time in life. It is the leading cause of sudden death in athletes and young people. Abbreviated HCM. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Men and women with HCM stand a 50-50 chance of transmitting the HCM gene to each of their children.Measurement of the thickness of the left ventricle wall can predict who is most at risk for HMC. The test is done by echocardiography, a routine ultrasound test of the heart. Persons with a maximum wall thickness less than three-quarters of an inch (19 mm) are virtually free of risk for fatal cardiac arrest over the next 20 years whereas those with a wall thickness more than 1.2 inches (30 mm) have a 40% chance of fatal cardiac arrest during that time period. Patients in danger can be fitted with implantable defibrillators.Also called familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is your opinion about guys running in running tights?
QUESTION CONTENT: I am pretty athletic and do sports. I prefer to run in long running tights during winter because I like the freedom, unlike heavy sweatpants that kind of weighs you down. And it is heck a lot easier to wash and not smelly than sweatpants.But my dad hates it, I meant really hate it. He says it is the ugly piece of clothing I have. He says any kind of tights just look like crap. I also wear underarmor tight shirt,otherwise I get bleeding nipples during long runs; and my dad hates that too. Some of my friend also say I should lose running tights.I don t understand why people find it objectionable though. We wear it during football, so why can t we wear it during running?But I don t really have problem wearing it and have the physique for it. But this constant nagging from other people is putting a dent in my confident in wearing it.So what do you think when you see a guy running in tights? Do you find it weird or anything? Or do you mind?But I never wear underarmor tights shirt alone, it is always worn as an underwear under other piece of clothing. Otherwise it is toooo gxx.By the way, it is worn strictly outdoor when the temperature is cold, near 32 degree or slightly above that. There is no way I would wear that in gym.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 17
I wear running tights also. Keep the tights. You should be running in wicking material in winter, and not in cotton sweatpants, where you are more likely to sweat, and the sweat will freeze. Guys in running tights are superhot, and I drool when I see them! Waddle on, friend!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1279
as a 23 yr old woman if the guy is fit and in shape, tights are sexy and they don t leave anything to the imagination.    ; )my preference for men though, jogging shorts, no shirt.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1280
I wear the underarmor top, but not the shorts....though, for me, thats mostly cause I don t have the physique for it...as far as I m concerned you gotta earn it! Nothing at all wrong with the top, I love the way it feels...bottoms, I wouldn t say anything wrong either, though I personally wouldn t wear them.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1281
Chances are your dad wouldn t object to your wearing a raincoat if it were raining, but I won t suggest you try to fight him on this.  If you are (or he is) concerned about the look tights give you, then put a pair of shorts on over them.  When the weather is cold but not frigid I wear tights with baggy shorts over them.  My legs stay warm but I get the freedom of motion that you get from the tights.  Specialized running shorts work too.  You could try wearing the tights under the running pants, but I usually save that for really cold weather.  You might want to try a pair of nylon windpants - they don t have all of the freedom of movement of tights, but aren t as out there. Bear in mind though that frostbite is a serious concern in cold weather.  Any of your...ahem...extremities are subject to getting frost bitten and...well let s just say that wearing tights alone could subject you to a brutally painful case of frostbite if you run in seriously cold weather.If you are getting bleeding or irritation anywhere then check out Body Glide or another anti-chafing product.  But I will admit there is a part of me that enjoys the look on people s faces when they see blood on my shirt...
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1282
keep running no matter what other people say things about what u wear. if its comfy, wear it! shorts r my thing when running. even in 32 or lower. im not a sweats person. so, it depends on u. ignore those rude remarks and do whats comfy!
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1827
It is gross
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1829
I don t really see any point in caring if a guy wears tights or not-just put a pair of shorts on over them, to hide the little guys better, and live with it (girls should wear shorts over their tights too, btw--funny story about that...my spanish teacher s a marathon runner, and she leaves from school to go running, so one time during xc we were leaving on a run and we see her going out in this pair of bright 80 s tights with no shorts on top...ew.)   Anyway, to answer the question-if a guy has shorts over his tights while running, I see no problem with it.   Even if he doesn t...I ll just look at them, be like ok... and get over it.   Do whatever you like-just take the shorts comment seriously :)   Good luck with your dad, and with your running! (and football too)

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1044
Calculus is a central branch of mathematics, developed from algebra and geometry. It is built on two major complementary ideas, both of which rely critically on the concept of limits. The first is differential calculus, which is concerned with the instantaneous rate of change of quantities with respect to other quantities, or more precisely, the local behaviour of functions. This can be illustrated by the slope of a function s graph. The second is integral calculus,which studies the accumulation of quantities, such as areas under a curve, linear distance traveled, or volume displaced. These two processes act inversely to each other, as shown by the fundamental theorem of calculus.Examples of typical differential calculus problems include:finding the acceleration and velocity of a free-falling body at a particular moment. finding the optimal number of units a company should produce to maximize its profit. Examples of integral calculus problems include:finding areas and volumes finding the amount of water pumped by a pump with a set power input but varying conditions of pumping losses and pressure finding the amount of parking lot plowed by a snowplow of given power with varying rates of snowfall. Today, calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, in computer science, in statistics, and in engineering; in economics, business, and medicine; and as a general method whenever the goal is an optimal solution to a problem that can be given in mathematical form.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what do you like more baseball with or without dh?
QUESTION CONTENT: the dh rules was just to give the american league and advantage over the national league A real baseball player can play the field not just hit homeruns
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2245
I wouldnt mind it either way but give it to both leagues its just dumb how much better the AL is than the NL
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 125
i like it without the dh. more strategy involved. not just go out there and see who can out-slug the other team.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 926
Yeah, definately I agree with you. I m a Mets fan, also a National League fan. Baseball was fine without the DH rule forty years ago, and it does give the AL an advantage. I never understood why it was established in only half of MLB, and it should go.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 927
I m a fan of the National League, so I like baseball without a dh.  I think everyone who plays on the field should be able to bat, and everyone who bats should be able to play the field.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 928
I m a fan of the American League so of course I HATE the DH rule. So much strategy is lost. It s pitiful. There are better DH ides than this one where a cyclops comes to bat and the pitcher doesn t. It s a dumb rule.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2143
I agree...I would not want to be a DH or an american league pithcer because I would want to field/pitch and hit
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2246
good question,,i like the game with the d.h i don t think the pitcher should have to bat,,most of them suck anyways so why bother  and there one of the most imporant players on the team and there job is hard enough now they can get beemed or pull a mussle running,,no i like the d h rule
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2247
I like it either way. I like it with because that gives me a chance to watch an extra player. And i like it without because it s more old school.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2248
No DH. The game gets more dynamic without it. More head games within the game.Plus if you brush someone back it may come back to haunt you.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2249
i like the game without the dh bc most f the time (not zampbrano) the pitcher cant hit and it one automatic out while with the dh u have a more offensive (exciting) game.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2250
i like both but if i had to pick i would go with out because i like seeing pitcher like zambrodo from chi town hit home run and make other pitcher look stupid
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2251
just to give over the hill players few more years by putting them in DH??? (i.e. Frank Thomas...Barry Bond...)  no thanks....If you can t play defense, time for you to retire...National League is so much more compelling...What do you think went through Clemens mind when he came up to bat at the Shea Stadium after he almost took Piazza s head off at the Yankee Stadium...??or...you won t see starter getting pulled around 5 or 6th inning for   pinch hitter when game is tight...DH rule just is not baseball enough...(even though one of my favorite player spent more than half of his career as DH...Edgar Martinez)

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is DSP?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2653
It could mean Digital Signal Processor. Digital signal processing (DSP) is the study of signals in a digital representation and the processing methods of these signals. DSP and analog signal processing are subfields of signal processing. DSP has three major subfields: audio signal processing, digital image processing and speech processing.Since the goal of DSP is usually to measure or filter continuous real-world analog signals, the first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by using an analog to digital converter. Often, the required output signal is another analog output signal, which requires a digital to analog converter.The algorithms required for DSP are sometimes performed using specialized computers, which make use of specialized microprocessors called digital signal processors (also abbreviated DSP). These process signals in real time and are generally purpose-designed ASICs. ~ Quoted from WikipediaMore detail can be found here>>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing

I wanted to not have anymore fears about letting my music out and writing songs and doing things that were different or against the grain. Crabbukit in particular, that song had a certain potential, not being afraid to put it out there because it could go this way or that way. Just taking that step forward.The low was during the whole jiggy era of hip-hop, when I just wasn???t inspired to rap. I thought hip-hop was dead, and yadda yadda yadda. I was really negative because I couldn???t relate to that lifestyle. So, I didn???t have a place for the first time in my life as a fan and as an MC, I didn???t have a place in the music. It was weird to me.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Angina?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2978
Angina refers to symptoms such as chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It is often the first sign of heart disease. The heart is a muscle that gets blood flow from the coronary arteries. If your coronary arteries have a blockage or narrowing that reduces blood flow to the heart, you may experience angina. People with angina usually feel discomfort (often pressure-like pain) in or around the chest, shoulders, back, neck, jaw or arms. It may feel like a squeezing pressing sensation. Angina is usually caused and made worse by exercise and eased by rest. The pain usually lasts 2-5 minutes. If you have this kind of chest pain, contact your health care provider. You can take medicine that will help your angina. If you suspect you are having a heart attack (see warning signs), call 911. Not all chest discomfort is angina. Acid reflux, lung infections or inflammation can cause chest pain.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2979
Angina is a term most commonly used to state of felling of chest pain, the major cause is incomplete supply of oxygenated oxygenated  blood to heart, by the coronary arteries. Even a cold weather can precipitate an Angina.

QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2857
One day a stranger walked by. Spare some change? mumbled the beggar, I have nothing to give you, said the stranger. Then he asked: What s that you re sitting on?  Nothing, replied the beggar. Just an old box. I ve been sitting on it for as long as I can remember. Ever look inside?, asked the stranger. No, said the beggar. What s the point, there s nothing in there.  Have a look inside, insisted the stranger. The beggar, reluctantly, managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold.I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside yourself.Eckhart Tolle, from The Power of NOWEckhart Tolle was born in Germany, where he spent the first thirteen years of his life. After graduating from the University of London, he was a research scholar and supervisor at Cambridge University. When he was twenty-nine, a profound spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and radically changed the course of his life. The next few years were devoted to understanding, integrating and deepening that transformation, which marked the beginning of an intense inward journey. Eckhart Tolle is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition. In his teaching, he conveys a simple yet profound message with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters: there is a way out of suffering and into peace. Eckhart is currently traveling extensively, taking his teaching and his presence throughout the world.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Existential Angst?  And why are some more prone to it than others? (NO GLIB ANSWERS...EXPOUND!)?
QUESTION CONTENT: PLEASE NO SMART-@SS ANSWERS.  BE REAL...TRY AT LEAST.  Is existential angst self-obsession or legitimate angst?   Is it feeling sorry for oneself or questioning the status quo of life and looking for more meaning?  Why are some people more prone to it than others who don t seemed worried/in wonder of their role or destiny in life at all? And then, if you get that far.  How does one get out of it?  Move past worrying about destiny and being and then to the next step of living with that awareness?I am loving these answers!! Thank you all thus far...especially the ones that really thought about it and went off!! I am getting a little clearer from some of the comments already but will keep it open just a bit longer to see what else pops up! thanks! Good thinking folks!
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2805
Existential angst is the anxiety of the possibly meaninglessness of existence.  Is it legitimate or self-obsessive?  I would have to say that depends on the degree to which it is taken.  Some questioning of meaning and tradition is a good thing, but a person who suffers because the meaning of life is not spelled out in the sky in large golden letters is taking it too far.  If one uses it as a legitimate platformto question the assumptions and existence of their life, I would take it as a positive thing.  If instead of using their existential angst to rebuild a stronger self with a more defensible outlook on life, they wallow in self-pity and depression, they are probably approaching the issue from the wrong angle.  Whether somebody experiences existential angst or not, and the degree to which they experience it depends largely on the experiences they have encountered in life.  I believe that somebody who lives comfortably, never hears any challenges to their worldview, nevers hears any contrary opinions, and never has any experience causing them to question their assumptions would not be too likely to have existential angst.  Unfortunately (or fortunately if you look at it a different way) this is very rare.  Almost everybody at some point in their life encounters a problem which their personal philosophy has trouble resolving.  I think that people not feeling existential angst are probably those on opposite ends of the spectrum:  they have either never been exposed to the real world and have never wondered about their prupose, or they have thought about the issue extensively and resolved it to their satisfaction.  How to get out of existential angst?  There are a lot of answers.  I think Heidegger would say to become an authentic self - do that which is true your self.  Nietzsche would say to live your life aesthetically, not worrying about tradition, but instead seeing your life as an artwork.  Buddhism says to recognize that the idea of a self separated from the world and others is a dangerous illusion, an illusion which causes existential angst.  Me personally, not that i have resolved the meaning of my own existence, I would say to find a community which shares your values and interests because humans get personal value from social interaction and meaning from tradition.  Also to recognize that having a meaning prescribed to you (as most people seem to want) is actually a worse option than choosing your own meaning.  Every moment that you spend worrying about your existence is one less moment to be enjoying that existence, so act.UPDATE: i was a little sloppy with my heidegger answer, he would say to be authentic, which to him means being in the world and caring for the world.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 911
We are accustomed to experiencing purpose in our lives.  Everything around us has a purpose.  The oven, chair, clock, computer, house, phone, and even the animals seems to serve each others purpose in the balance of life.  But what about us, and our purpose?  Within the span of a 70-80 year old life, at some point, there is a question asked about self purpose.  For some that question looms for their whole life.  For others, this craving is satisfied.Is this feeling legitimate?  If I were to say ???No??? then that would imply a lack of hope.  If you have hope for eternal truth then the desire to search it out will never leave.  So instead of the pain in angst, consider the hope of truth and the resolution between yourself and that truth.Now your last question is actually a VERY good one.  Because it implies that you recognize the responsibility of knowing the truth.  Once you have found the truth you must live with your relationship to that truth.  If your life is not in harmony with the truth then YOU must be the one to change, as the truth will not.  So perhaps the first step in the journey is, understanding that you must be willing to change.  Once the pain of change has occurred however, the world is discovered again, as if you are looking through a new window of beliefs.  The experience is not terrifying but liberating.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 912
Certainly there exists a full spectrum of responses to the curiosty of life s meaning. On one end of that spectrum could be Existential, ie life has no meaning. It simply is because you perceive it to be; If there is a meaning to life, it too, existentially, must exist only because you percieve it. To ponder the order of existence or your place in it is simply recreational. Just like solving sudokus, some people enjoy the pondering more than others. (This does not include those whose intellect simply precludes philosophical ponderings.) While notfamiliar with the term Existential Angst, I presume it is both legitamate and obsessive in your case. Legitimate because it is unavoidable, and obsessive because you percieve it to be.I would not say get out of it ! Explore the curiosity of life s mission or lack thereof.... fearlessly. Accept that you can never know, and pursue the best course.

QUESTION SUBJECT: do you like the name nahvionna(nah-vi-on-na) for a girl?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 1324
I think the name is pretty, but it has been mentioned here that it would be hard to pronounce and spell.  I do agree with that.   A name is a very personal thing and when a parent gives a name to a child, it is usually chosen from the heart.  With that said, I think it is terrible that some people are so rotten as to say that its gay or make anything other than the constructive criticism you asked for.If you feel in your heart that Nahvionna is the name you would like to give your child, then do it. I have a first name that can be spelled several different ways and a last name that can be spelled  two different ways.  You get used to spelling your name over time. I don t think anything of it anymore.  Heck, I even have to spell my street name and its longer than my first and last name put together. You might want to try alternate spellings.  How about Nahviana?  I  think it would be less difficult for people to pronounce that way.  It seems a little more straight forward.Anyway, the name is pretty and you should name your child what your heart tells you to.  Many of the answerers on this forum are real wise crackers and only answer to get their two points with very little regard for your feelings.  Do what your heart tells you to,not what some Yahoo tells you to do.  You ll be happier in the long run.  Blessings,

Adhesions are pathological bonds between surfaces within body cavities. These bonds can be a thin film of connective tissue, a thick fibrous bridge containing blood vessels and nerve tissue, or a direct contact between two organ surfaces.As pointed out in your question, there is a pathological adhesion (abnormal union of two parts, often after inflammation; a band of fibrous tissue which joins such parts) between plura (a thin serous membrane covering the surface of the lung) and pericardium (the double membranous sac which envelops the heart).This may happen after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). This restricts the movement of both the parts.

Thymic Cancer is a cancer of the thymus gland or thymic tissue. The thymus gland is in the upper part of the mediastinum (chest) behind the sternum and extending upwards into the root of the neck. It is a small organ that slowly decreases in size during adulthood and is gradually replaced by fat tissue.  During fetal development and childhood, the thymus produces white blood cells, called lymphocytes,  that travel to lymph nodes throughout the body. There they help the immune system protect the body from infections..  The thymus contains two types of cells: epithelial cells and lymphocytes. Thymic epithelial cells are the cells that line the thymus, and are the origin cells of thymoma and thymic carcinoma. If lymphocytes become malignant (cancerous), they can develop into lymphoma.There are a number of  thymic conditions and the terminology often gets confused between them. For example;A thymoma is typically a slow growing tumor. Its cells look similar to the normal cells of the thymus and it usually does not spread beyond the thymus. People with thymoma, however,  often have other diseases as well. The most common is myasthenia gravis, a disease that weakens the muscles, but others include polymyositis, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, Sjogren s syndrome, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Thymoma has been associated with an increased risk for second malignancies, which appears to be unrelated to thymectomy, radiation therapy, or a clinical history of  myasthenia gravis. Because of  this increased risk for second malignancies and the fact that thymoma can recur after a long interval, it has been recommended that surveillance should be lifelong.Thymomas are rare, accounting for about 0.2% to 1.5% of all cancers. Approximately 90% of tumors of the thymus are thymoma. The remaining 10% are thymic carcinoma, carcinoid tumors, or lymphomas. Thymic carcinoma  on the other hand is a thymic epithelial tumor that exhibits a set of histologic features no longer specific to the thymus, but rather similar to those histologic features observed in carcinomas of other organs. In contrast to thymomas, thymic carcinomas lack immature lymphocytes. Any lymphocytes that are present are mature and usually admixed with plasma cells. Thymic carcinomas are usually advanced when diagnosed and have a higher recurrence rate and worse survival compared with thymoma. In contrast to the thymomas, the association of thymic carcinoma and autoimmune disease is rare.The above information is basically an extract from the Foundation of Thymic Cancer Research . This is an excellent site for information on this rare form of cancer and also has a great forum. I ve included a link below, for your information.As a Thymic Carcinoma survivor, I/ve spent countless hours finding out as much as I can on the subject. Some information good and some not so good. The thing is to remember that everyone is different and not get too bogged down on survival statistics, which on the surface do not look promising, but then you relise that these statistics are based on very small sample numbers. Hardly a good representation of what is going to be the case with a particular individual. For me, I was diagnosed Aug. 2006, had 24 session of chemo, followed by a sternotomy to remove the tumour and then 6 weeks of Radio Therapy to mop up any remaining microscopic cells. Now the wait for the next scan in August!Everyones treatment is different and you need to focus and forge ahead.If you need more information or wish to discuss things further, consider joining the forum. It is a good support and information source.All the best for your brother and yourself.

Thymus Cancer Also called: Thymic carcinoma, Thymoma The thymus is a small organ in your upper chest, under your breastbone. Before birth and during childhood, the thymus helps the body make a type of white blood cell. These cells help protect you from infections. Cancer of the thymus is rare. You are more likely to get it if you have other diseases such as myasthenia gravis, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes there are no symptoms.

Nothing is a description.  All in your head.  It is not a state of the universe.  In that way, it s a lot like math.Consider an empty basket.  You might ask someone what is in it, and they would say, Nothing .  But what they REALLY mean is nothing of importance to me right now ... after all, the basket is filled with atmosphere, light, and even space.Nor is the emptiest void in our universe devoid of things.  Virtual particles spring into (and out of) being constantly, providing something even in the most apparently empty of spaces.  The fabric of reality which provides the space itself might even be thought of as something which is always present.About things which are truly devoid of even space we have no information at all.  Perhaps that is the best way to think of nothing - devoid not only of objects, but also information and imagining.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Evil?
QUESTION CONTENT: I am almost positive it doesn t exist.  So what do you all think?  I am after a philosophical answer, not a religous one.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2950
Socrates had a very excellent argument from the opposite angle about the nature of good.  It s contained in the book Euthyphro , which I highly recommend reading (the first link, below).  It s unusual among the Socratic dialogues in that it does not come to any definite kind of conclusion - Socrates cannot find a definition of what is good, even though everyone seems to think they know what it is.You ll note we see the same thing here.  Everyone has asserted strongly that they know of evil and it definitely exists.  They can provide numerous examples of evil, but no concrete definition that will embrace all the supposed evil acts and leave none of them out.  I suspect even those who could cough up a kind of definition would only be able to do so by closing their eyes to some atrocities and giving black marks to some acts of generousity.Certainly if we take the stance that some have that evil is the opposite or absense of good, then we have basically said that evil does not exist, as you seem to suspect.  Consider light.  You might call the opposite of light darkness , but there is no REAL darkness.  You cannot put darkness on a table like you can put light.  Darkness has no existance.  It is just a short way of saying, the light is not here , and provides no additional information other than that.  By the same token, if evil is ONLY not-good, then there is no evil.A good way to determine if the latter is the case, is to see if you can find an example of something that is BOTH good AND evil.  If you can simultaneously have both qualities in the same thing, then they are different qualities, obviously enough.Personally, I take the position that good always has an implied for .  There is nothing that is just good, and what is good for one thing could be (and usually is) evil for another thing.  In that sense it IS possible to be both good and evil at the same time, just for different things.  To put forward an example, the good of the human race sometimes requires evil of the individual (and vice versa!).  I have yet to discover any thing which could be considered universally good and thus to have no evil whatsoever.I also tend to equate good with promoting survival and evil with reducing survival .  Thus something can be notgood without being evil if it just has no effect on the survival of whatever it is you are considering.But those latter things are just me.  What do you think?

Ahhh, what a good question. I feel evil is a trait that is unique to humans. I think evil exists in the hearts of men.Evil is summed up in what the church calls the seven deadly sins.Most suffering in the history of humanity can be traced to one of these sins (or concepts). Of all of these I feel greed is the strongest.Evil is when one man exploits thousands of people so he may be rich and powerful. Evil is when a molester injures a child to satisfy his sick urges. Evil is when a man dumps toxic material in the ocean to make money. Evil is when a person is angry so they take another s life. Evil is when a man uses violence to oppress a group of people so that he may gain wealth and power. As you can see from my examples evil is in the hearts of men. When a man does something that hurts one or more people so that he and only he profits in some manner he has done something evil.

This is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. It is a variant of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (also called neurosarcoma, neurogenic sarcoma, neurofibrosarcoma and malignant schwannoma.) You may get better information if you join a sarcoma message board at Sarcoma Alliance. Sarcoma in adults is very rare and the message board brings together all different types of people with sarcoma. You may be able to find others with this same condition and share information:http://www.sarcomaalliance.com/From what I recall you need to be careful about the spelling of Epitheloid as I have alsoseen it spelled Epithelioid . Epithelioid Sarcomas Epithelioid sarcomas typically occur in the hand or foot of young adults. They appear like small nodules, which sometimes merge together. Spreading to lymph nodes occurs in approximately 20% of patients. Because of their proximity to the joints, surgical excision can be difficult and often amputation is the surgery of choice for long-term survival. - Sarcoma Alliance Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST)http://www.liddyshriversarcomainitiative.org/Newsletters/V03N03/mpnst/mpnst.htmCancerBackup: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST)http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/QAs/SofttissuesarcomasQAs/AllQAs/related_faqs/QAs/377Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor http://www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/Diseases/mpnst.htmNCI: Soft Tissue Sarcomahttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/DMOZ Directory:http://dmoz.org/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer/Musculoskeletal/Soft_Tissue_Sarcoma/Epithelioid_Sarcoma/http://dmoz.org/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer/Musculoskeletal/Soft_Tissue_Sarcoma/Malignant_Schwannoma/http://dmoz.org/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer/Musculoskeletal/Soft_Tissue_Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma/Good luck with this.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Ebola?
QUESTION CONTENT: This is  a virus that first started off in the Congo.
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3036
Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 50-90% of all clinically ill cases. Human infection with the Ebola Reston subtype, found in the Western Pacific, has only caused asymptomatic illness, meaning that those who contract the disease do not experience clinical illness. The natural reservoir of the Ebola virus seems to reside in the rain forests of the African continent and in areas of the Western Pacific . TransmissionThe Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Burial ceremonies where mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased person can play a significant role in the transmission of Ebola. The infection of human cases with Ebola virus has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes--both dead and alive--as was documented in C??te d Ivoire, the Republic of Congo and Gabon. The transmission of the Ebola Reston strain through the handling of cynomolgus monkeys has also been reported. Health care workers have frequently been infected while treating Ebola patients, through close contact without the use of correct infection control precautions and adequate barrier nursing procedures. Incubation period: two to 21 days.SymptomsEbola is often characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is often followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings show low counts of white blood cells and platelets as well as elevated liver enzymes. DiagnosisSpecialized laboratory tests on blood specimens detect specific antigens and/or genes of the virus. Antibodies to the virus can be detected, and the virus can be isolated in cell culture. Tests on samples present an extreme biohazard risk and are only conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. New developments in diagnostic techniques include non-invasive methods of diagnosis (testing saliva and urine samples) and testing inactivated samples to provide rapid laboratory diagnosis to support case management during outbreak control activities. Therapy and vaccineSevere cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. No specific treatment or vaccine is yet available for Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Several vaccine candidates are being tested but it could be several years before any are available. A new drug therapy has shown early promise in laboratory studies and is currently being evaluated further. However, this too will take several years. Experimental studies involving the use of hyper-immune sera on animals have demonstrated no protection against the disease.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who was Alvarez Cabral?
QUESTION CONTENT: I need this information for an exam tomorrow. Thankyou =p
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2500
Pedro ??lvares Cabral (c. 1467 - c. 1520), was a Portuguese navigator and explorer, generally regarded as first European discoverer of Brazil (April 22, 1500).He is thought to have been born in Belmonte, in the Beira Baixa province of Portugal. He was the third son of Fern??o Cabral (c.1427-c.1492), Governor of Beira and Belmonte, and Isabel de Gouveia de Queir??s (c.1433-c.1483; descendent of the first King of Portugal, Afonso I), and married Isabel de Castro, the daughter of the distinguished Fern??o de Noronha (also descendent of King Afonso I). He must have had excellent training in navigation and large experience as a seaman, for King Manuel I of Portugal considered him competent to continue the work of Vasco da Gama.His commision was to establish permanent commercial relations and to introduce Christianity wherever he went, using force of arms when necessary to gain his point. The nature of the undertaking led rich Florentine merchants to contribute to the equipment of the ships, and priests to join the expedition. Among the captains of the fleet, which consisted of 13 ships with 1,500 men, were Bartolomeu Dias, P??ro Vaz de Caminha, and Nicolau Coelho, the latter the companion of Vasco da Gama. Vasco da Gama himself gave the directions necessary for the course of the voyage.The fleet left Lisbon on March 9, 1500, and following the course laid down, sought to avoid the calms of the coast of Gulf of Guinea. On leaving the Cape Verde Islands, where Lu??s Pires was forced by a storm to return to Lisbon, they sailed in a decidedly southwesterly direction. On April 22 a mountain was visible, to which the name of Monte Pascoal was given; on the April 23 Cabral landed on the coast of Brazil, and on the April 25 the entire fleet sailed into the harbor called Porto Seguro. Cabral perceived that the new country lay east of the line of demarcation made by pope Alexander VI (see Treaty of Tordesillas), and at once sent Andr?? Gon??alves (according to other authorities Gaspar de Lemos) to Portugal with the important tidings. Believing the newly-discovered country to be an island he gave it the name of Island of the True Cross (or Island of Vera Cruz) and took possession of it by erecting a cross and holding a religious service. The service was celebrated by the Franciscan, Father Henrique, afterwards Bishop of Ceuta.Cabral resumed his voyage on May 3 1500. By the end of the month the fleet approached the Cape of Good Hope, where it was struck by a storm in which four vessels, including that of Bartolomeu Dias, were lost. With the ships now reduced to one-half of the original number. Cabral reached Sofala (July 16) and Mozambique (July 20). In the latter place he received a cordial greeting. On July 26 he came to Kilwa where he was unable to make an agreement with the ruler. On August 2 he reached Melinde; here he had a friendly welcome and obtained a pilot to take him to India. On August 10, the ship commanded by Diogo Dias, separated by weather, discovered an island they named after St Lawrence, later known as Madagascar.Cabral continued to India to trade for pepper and other spices, establishing a factory at Calicut, where he arrived on September 13. In Cochin and Cananor Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties. After a chain of bad luck, culminating in a two-day bombardment of the city, Cabral started on the return voyage on January 16, 1501, and returned with only 4 of 13 ships to Portugal, on June 23, 1501.Cabral was buried in a monastery in Santar??m, Portugal. He has been honored on a number of postage stamps, for instance in a set of Brazilian stamps issued January 1, 1900 to mark the 400th anniversary of the discovery. In Brazil, he is also in the 1 cent coin, and in a special edition of the R$10 (10 Reais) note.

Around the tenth century AD the Christian church was struggling with the same philosophical question, and they came up with what I believe was a good answer. They decided that God, and faith in God, has three essential aspects. First is the concept of an able and creative God. A God beyond human understanding, a God free of the constraints of time and space, able to create the universe, and able to overcome the enigma of God s own creation. Second is the concept of a loving God. A God who molded the human mind in his own image, endowing it with his own freedom, yet wanting it to be creative, wanting it to be helpful, supportive, and loving of all things. Third is the concept of an influential God within each and every human soul.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Who is Jamshid? Who is Rustom?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2880
JAMSHED and ROSTAM are both mythical Iranian(Persian) Kings that were writen about in the Ferdowsi s Epic of Kings -Shahnama which is a Persian epic starting from the begining of the world up to the 7th century.  Jamshed is from the mythical age, and Rostam from the heroic age.They are both characters from the Zoroastrian religion. And mentioned in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.Shah JAMSHED  was  the fourth Peshdadian king,  and greatest of the early Sh??hs of mankind in Firdaus?? s Sh??hn??ma. The Book of Kings or The Epic of Kings written  around 1000, is the national epic of Iran.The Sh??h Jamsh??d of Persian mythology is based on the figure Yima X??a??ta of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. Yima X??a??ta is in turn is based on a proto-Indo-Iranian heroic figure  Yamas, from whom Vedic Yama also derives. In the Avesta, Yima was the son of Viva??hat, who in turn corresponds to the Vedic Vivasvat, he who shines out , a divinity of the Sun.He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dying of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing shipsAnd he said to be the discoverer of wine!!!ROSTAM  is a mythical hero of ancient Persia, son of Zal and Rudaba. In some ways, the position of Rostam in the historical tradition is curiously parallel to that of Surena, the hero of the Carrhae. His figure was endowed with many features of the historical personality of Rostam. The latter was always represented as the mightiest of Iranian paladins, and the atmosphere of the episodes in which he features is strongly reminiscent of the Arsacid period. He was immortalized by the 10th century poet Ferdowsi of Tus in the Shahnameh or Epic of Kings, which contain pre-Islamic folklore and historyRostam is the champion of champions and is involved in numerous stories, constituting some of the most popular (and arguably some of most masterfully created) parts of the Shahnameh. As a young child, he slays the maddened white elephant of the king Manuchehr with just one blow of the mace owned by his grand father Sam, son of Nariman. He then tames his legendary stallion, Rakhsh.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Dirak Delta?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2755
The Dirac delta function, sometimes referred to as the unit impulse function and introduced by the British theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, can usually be informally thought of as a function ??(x) that has the value of infinity for x = 0, the value zero elsewhere. The integral from minus infinity to plus infinity is 1. The discrete analog of the delta function is the degenerate distribution which is sometimes known as a delta function.OverviewDirac functions can be of any size in which case their strength A is defined by duration multiplied by amplitude. The graph of the delta function can be usually thought of as following the whole x-axis and the positive y-axis. (This informal picture can sometimes be misleading, for example in the limiting case of the sinc function.)Despite its name, the delta function is not a function as defined in the strictest mathematical sense. One reason for this is because the functions f(x) = ??(x) and g(x) = 0 are equal everywhere except at x = 0 yet have integrals that are ostensibly different. According to Lebesgue integration theory, if f, g are functions such that f = g almost everywhere, then f is integrable iff g is integrable and the integrals of f and g are the same. Precise treatment of the Dirac delta requires measure theory or the theory of distributions.The Dirac delta is very useful as an approximation for a tall narrow spike function (an impulse). It is the same type of abstraction as a point charge, point mass or electron point. For example, in calculating the dynamics of a baseball being hit by a bat, approximating the force of the bat hitting the baseball by a delta function is a helpful trick. In doing so, one not only simplifies the equations, but one also is able to calculate the motion of the baseball by only considering the total impulse of the bat against the ball rather than requiring knowledge of the details of how the bat transferred energy to the ball.The Dirac delta function was named after the Kronecker delta, since it can be used as a continuous analogue of the discrete Kronecker delta.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2756
The Dirac-Delta potential is the unit impulse function (a function that looks as a spike having amplitude 1 and 0 width).  It is a purely mathematical construct used in various signal processing and quantum mechanical applications.  It s derivative is the Kronecker-Delta.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is HDL?
QUESTION CONTENT: and what is the best exercise to increase the hdl? Does yoga helpful for this? If someone has low hdl, what is the instant exercise he should do to bring level up?IF YOU HAVE LOW HDL, WHAT EXERCISE DO YOU RECOMMEND TO INCREASE THE HDL LEVEL?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1774
HDL means High density lipoprotein. It is a good cholesterol.Epidemiological studies have shown that high concentrations of HDL (over 60 mg/dL) have protective value against cardiovascular diseases (such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction). Low concentrations of HDL (below 40 mg/dL for men, below 50 mg/dL for women) are a positive risk factor for these atherosclerotic diseases.Raising HDLCertain changes in lifestyle can have a positive impact on raising HDL levels:Aerobic exercise Weight loss Smoking cessation Removing trans fatty acids from the diet Adding monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats to the diet Drinking 1-2 servings of alcoholic beverages per day Adding soluble fiber to diet Limiting intake of dietary fat to 30-35% of total calories Consumption of Niacin (immediate release crystallin form of Vitamin B3) can increase HDL levels by 15-30%.In the meanwhile you have to reduce, LDL, triglycerides and Serum cholesterol. Cholesterol- Get your LDL (bad cholesterol) levels checked at least once a year. (Target: Below 100 mg/dL). Triglycerides. (Target: Less than 150 mg/dL) Serum Cholesterol (Target: Less than 200 mg/dL) HDL (good cholesterol) (Target: More than 50 mg/dL)Eat a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet. This kind of diet includes cottage cheese, fat-free milk, fish (not canned in oil), vegetables, poultry, egg whites, and polyunsaturated oils and margarines (corn, safflower, canola, and soybean oils). Avoid foods with excess fat in them such as meat (especially liver and fatty meat), egg yolks, whole milk, cream, butter, shortening, lard, pastries, cakes, cookies, gravy, peanut butter, chocolate, olives, potato chips, coconut, cheese (other than cottage cheese), coconut oil, palm oil, and fried foods.Unsaturated fat A type of fat found mainly in foods from plant and fish sources. They include polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats. Eatingunsaturated fats rather than saturated fats helps to reduce the blood cholesterol level.Changes in lifestyle habits are the main therapy for hypertriglyceridemia. These are the changes you need to make:???If you re overweight, cut down on calories to reach your ideal body weight. This includes all sources of calories, from fats, proteins, carbohydrates and alcohol.  ???Reduce the saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol content of your diet.  ???Reduce your intake of alcohol considerably. Even small amounts of alcohol can lead to large changes in plasma triglyceride levels.  ???Be physically active for at least 30 minutes on most or all days each week.  ???People with high triglycerides may need to substitute monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats ??? such as those found in canola oil, olive oil or liquid margarine ??? for saturated fats. Substituting carbohydrates for fats may raise triglyceride levels and may decrease HDL ( good ) cholesterol in some people.  ???Substitute fish high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of meats high in saturated fat like hamburger. Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega-3 fatty acids.Please see the webpages for more details on HDL, LDL, Triglycerides and Cholesterol.

Physics is the science of matter, energy and the interactions between the two. Within this framework, physics encompasses essentially all of nature: the laws and properties of matter and the forces acting upon it, especially the causes (gravitation, heat, light, magnetism, electricity, quantum effects etc) that modify the general properties of bodies. Physics is the study of motion ??? from objects as small as neutrinos to ones as massive as galaxies or even the entire universe ??? and forces ??? the interactions between bodies.Physics is traditionally divided into a large number of subfields, including thermodynamics, quantum physics, electromagnetism, acoustics, optics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, cryogenics, relativity, solid-state physics, condensed matter physics, particle physics and plasma physics.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is AutoSexuality?
QUESTION CONTENT: Is it about Self loving or is it Automobile loving?  Which one is true?Wikipedia has one answer and other people have another understanding ...
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 837
As a sexual preference, autosexuality refers to people who choose to have sex with themselves (that is, they prefer to masturbate rather than having interpersonal sex). The adjective is autosexual , as in autosexual behavior .It is rather rare for someone to be sexually attracted only to themselves when presented with a diverse range of possible mates.Some people consider autosexuality to be a paraphilia.Some people consider autosexuality as an exclusive preference to be a form of homosexuality, since all people are the same gender as themselves. Others find it to be a distinct sexual orientation or a distinct type of queerness. Still others say it has nothing to do with any of those things.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2712
One needs to be careful about Wikipedia, however, I believe that the term autosexuality was originaly used to label someone who masturbated instead of having sex with a partner.  Our culture has a very hard time separating sex from love so the phrase became associated with Self Love.  Love of self has the technical name of narrcissism not autosexuality.The thing about love of automobiles is a lark.

Oh, wow another Yankee hater asking a question so that other people will show their hate for the Yankees. I don t hate any team or player, baseball is just a game it s not real life. However, I do dislike the Boston Red Sox and DH Ortiz who whines that he does more for his team than Jeter does for the Yankees, and said of Jeter Let s see him hit in this lineup .  Well, DH Ortiz, you have Manny Ramirez hitting behind you, which is why you get all those fat pitches to hit. It means pitchers would rather pitch to YOU than Manny, who is scary.  DH Ortiz is breathing a sigh of relief now that it appears Manny is staying. Also, Curt Schilling and his big yap finish second. He made such a big deal out of A-Rod knocking the ball out of Arroyo s glove, yet it was OK for Orlando Cabrera to slide into second and throw elbows at Cairo in that series. He is also quick to insult and criticize others in the game. Who made this guy God?

There are at least as many levels of love as there are shades and hues from delicate pink to ruby red.  Moreover, these are arrayed along varying axes of import:  e.g., maternal love, paternal love, romantic love, love of God, love of good friends, etc.Most people are quite interested in romantic love, so here are two good authors:  Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Soul Mates and Twin Flames, and O. M. Aivanhov, Sexual Force or the Winged Dragon. Also, Martha Beck, Ph.D., gives a warm, funny, and profound account of her earning her Ph.D. at Harvard while carrying her unborn child to term.cordially,j.p.s.

Love cannot be described.. but i see it on how god loves everyone.. after someone does something soo horrible he still forgives you he still loves you no matter what you did
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2479
Definitely. There are different types of loving within a woman.Men may not understand this, sometimes, and they can be jealous on their own new born babies, e.g. Though a woman can both love as a mother, and as a wife; she can worship her husband the same time! A woman can love a man, as she could feel for her own child, when her husband may be in great physical need (drunken, . . . whatever). Those moments there is not passion or about anything alike, but it s still love, a different form. There are so many way to love someone . . .There is also passion, rough lust (?) - shall we name it love? It depends on partners. If they are just one for the other, without infidelities, it s still love. Else it should be kind of cannibalisation ?!?There is also love through the time passing. Like a noble wine. There is no passion through flesh attractiveness, maybe, who knows (?), but you see the person standing in front of you exactly like in the ever first day when you have to become in loved . . . and kiss his lips, and kiss his eyes, . . . cherishing him for the wonderful man he used to be till that very moment in front of you. You also have to feel for yourself such a plenitude because that man dedicated to you his heart, his body, his time, most of his thoughts. There should be such a great reciprocal gratitude and still striving for caress . . .There is still a feeling I cannot describe.It s so new for me.Shall it be the true pure love? What is this? Something which makes you feel easy like a feather, but strong and mighty as Achilles?
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2480
A long time ago I thought that love was something that you reserved for some special set of people that you had judged worthy of it. After a while I got to thinking about what Jesus had said about turning the other cheek and loving our neighbor I put the two together and realized that he had made no exceptions in these statements. It became obvious to me that he intended that we exclude no one from the love that we are supposed to be giving. I started thinking about my idea of love and suddenly realized that I had not been loving anyone at all. I had simply been judging everyone and every thing.Judging someone worthy of love is not love, it is only judgment. I actually started to cry when I realized this. I saw just how much of my life I had wasted being judgmental, thinking of myself as a Christian, when I was actually doing just the opposite of what Jesus had asked us to do.I thought about the verse judge not lest ye be judged, and I understood it for the first time.I realized that I have a lot of catching up to do. So many opportunities were wasted. I now try to apply the love that I have for the world in a universal way like Jesus asks us to do. If I start to feel afraid and think that I see someone that I should not love because of something I have thoughtor heard I try to catch my mistake as soon as possible. I tell myself that I have forgot the truth and have fallen for the same old trick that had cost me so many opportunities to be loving in the past. The horror of this realization is often all that is necessary to bring me back to my senses and make me drop the judgmental nonsense I was thinking.I still have a lot to learn about love, but at least I???m making progress.Love and blessings Your brother don

QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2724
stratosphere (str??t ??sf??r) , second lowest layer of the earth s atmosphere. The level from which it extends outward varies with latitude; it begins c.51/2 mi (9 km) above the poles, c.6 or 7 mi (c.10 or 11 km) in the middle latitudes, and c.10 mi (16 km) at the equator, and extends outward c.20 mi (32 km). It is a zone of dry, thin air, cold and clear, with a horizontal temperature gradient, that, in its lower level, is the reverse of that near the earth s surface. In polar regions the temperature is ???40??F to ???50??F (???40??C to ???46??C), but near the equator it ranges from ???80??F to below ???100??F (???62??C to below ???74??C); in the middle latitudes it remains steady at about ???67??F (???55??C).The stratified variations in temperature were deduced from the behavior of sound waves transmitted through the atmosphere, which travel faster in warm air than in cold air. Weather balloons carrying electronic equipment are launched to ascertain conditions in the stratosphere; information on this atmospheric layer is also acquired from earth-orbiting satellites.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 846
The region of atmosphere between troposphere and mesosphere. The layer of atmosphere that lies about 15 to 50 kilometres above the Earth s surface. In the stratosphere, the temperature rises with increasing height, which is the opposite of the situation in the lower atmosphere. Ozone occurs in minute quantities throughout the full depth of the atmosphere, but its concentration peaks within the stratosphere at an altitude of about 35 kilometres. This is referred to as the ozone layer.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 346
Believe it or not, this is a very interesting question. The modern descriptions of thermodynamics use the language of differential geometry, and in particular differential forms. Temperature and heat have very different mathematical roles in this formulation of thermodynamics. Although it sounds complicated, it makes much more sense than older descriptions. You might want to check it out. I was totally bored and frustrated by thermodynamics until I realized that it all made very nice sense when put in the language of forms.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 406
the hotter it is the more heat is in each air molecule. Temperature is just a measure of heat
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 879
 Hot is temperature, not heat.  For one object you could use them interchangeably, but two different objects can have the same amount of heat energy in them and be different temperatures.  Some things have more capacity to hold heat.Temperature vs Heat is kind of like Depth vs Water.  How deep a swimming pool is and how much water it has in it are different concepts.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1613
ok, temperature is teh measure of average kinetic energy of teh particles in a substance.  When you say its hot you mean both heat and Temperature, but heat is more meaningful because you arnt actually measuring anything, but you do feel the heat off of the object because teh air around something or the object itself doeshave the kinetic energy of the particles increased.  Heat is just mentioning that you feel that the kinetic energy of an object is higher than that of everything else aroudn it, or basically it means you feel that the kinetic energy of everythign is higher than youwould like it to be...heat is more of a perception where temperature is an actual measurement

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2966
Any mouth cancer should be taken very seriously and treated promptly and aggressively. Squamous cell of the tongue is a very dangerous and fairly common cancer, especially in smokers.http://www.tonguecancer.com/tongue_cancer.htm
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2967
Treatment of oral cancers depends on the stage of the cancer. If the cancer is caught and diagnosed early, a surgical procedure to remove the tumor may be all that is necessary. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, radiation and/or chemotherapy may be necessary,,An estimated 30,000 Americans are diagnosed with cancers of the mouth and tongue each year, and about 8,000 people die from these cancers annually. Oral cancers involve the lips, the tongue, the inner cheeks and the gums. Cancers of the jaw muscles, bones or salivary glands are not considered mouth cancers.

QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 836
Wayang kulit, the shadow puppets prevalent in Java and Bali, is without a doubt the best known of the Indonesian wayangs. The stories are usually drawn from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata or the Serat Menak. The island of Lombok has developed its own style of Serat Menak, so that the term Serat Menak Lombok is also common. Another form is the Punakawan with the figures of Semar, Bagong, Petruk and Gareng. Semar is the father of Gareng (oldest son), Petruk, and Bagong (youngest son). Instead of being based in the great epics, it is more of a political cabaret, dealing with gossip and contemporary affairs.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2730
I loved your answer to this question:http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApozKxetWXgNIOPS_GOTwG_sy6IX?qid=1006022807364;)  I just wanted to tell you I really liked that.I don t know too much about ayurveda, but I do know that you can sometimes find a watered down version of it.  So if you want the more authentic ayurveda, you should probably look on Hindu websites.  Ayurveda is the science of life, and is believed to have been given by God.  It considers peoples individual make-up instead of treating everyone the same.  It acknowledges different body types and does not ignore the spiritual element to sickness and healing.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is ATP? ADP? like can you simplify it for me please like really simplified!!!i have an exam tomarrow!!?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 118
ADP is adenosine diphosphate. Adenosine is the base used in DNA and RNA, here, separated from the sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) as an isolated diphosphated base.When you add another phosphate to it, it becomes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which can be thought of as a spring held tightly compressed, like a mouse trap, waiting to spring and release its extra energy and return to ADP.The body extracts energy from foods like protein, carbohydrate and lipids, and uses it to cock the trigger on the ATP (by phosphorylating ADP), where various reactions in the body can recognize it, cuddle up to it and receive its energy as it returns to the diphosphate form.This covers it nicely: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/biology/atp.html
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 119
ATP is a form of energy in a cell. it stands for Adenosine triphosphate. it consists on the ribose, adenine, and three phospate goroups. put how is it conservingenergy? it stores energy in the place where the phosphate bonds are joint. since they are all negatively charged, they repel each other, and alot of energy is used to keep them together. ADP is the molecule you get when one phosphate group frees itself from the molecule and releases enerhy. it stands for adenosine diphosphate.well, i hope this helped..if u have any other questions ill be happy to solve them for you :P
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 120
ATP is the universal energy carrier moleculeits real name is Adenosine Triphosphateit consists of one nucleic acid base (adenine), a sugar, and three phosphate groupsso it looks likeA-S-P-P-Pnow when the bond between the last phosphate is broken, the molecule becomes ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and energy is released. that released energy transfers to another system and is used there, so ATP triggers reactionslater, the phosphate that broke off the ATP molecule to form a ADP molecule rejoins with the ADP molecule. in this way, the ATP is restored and the molecule can be used over and over again

QUESTION CONTENT: A cancer likley found in kids an some teens .
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 223
A rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer, specifically a sarcoma (cancer of connective tissues), in which the cancer cells arise from skeletal muscle. Rhabdomyosarcomas predominantly affect children and young adults, but they may rarely affect older adults.Diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma depends on recognition of differentiation toward skeletal muscle cells. The protein myo D1 is a protein normally found in developing skeletal muscle cells which disappears after the muscle matures and becomes innervated by a nerve. Thus, myo D1 is not found in normal skeletal muscle and serves as a useful histochemical marker of rhabdomyosarcoma.Treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma consists of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is HIV?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 893
HIV is a virus that causes AIDS sickness.Human immunodeficiency virus, commonly known by the initialism HIV, is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It also directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough CD4+ T cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system functions poorly, leading to the syndrome known as AIDS. HIV also directly attacks organs, such as the kidneys, the heart and the brain leading to acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, dementia and encephalopathy. Many of the problems faced by people infected with HIV result from failure of the immune system to protect from opportunistic infections and cancers.HIV is transmitted through direct contact of a mucous membrane with a bodily fluid containing the HIV virus (such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid or breast milk). This transmission can come in the form of: penetrative (anal or vaginal) sex; oral sex; blood transfusion; contaminated needles; exchange between mother and infant during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding; or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 2758
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), either of two closely related retroviruses that invade T-helper lymphocytes and are responsible for AIDS. There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is responsible for the vast majority of AIDS in the United States. HIV-2, seen more often in western Africa, has a slower course than HIV-1. There are many strains of both types and the virus mutates rapidly, a trait that has made it especially difficult for researchers to find an effective treatment or vaccine. In many cases, a person s immune system will fight off the invasion of HIV for many years, producing billions of CD4 cells daily, always trying to keep up with the HIV s mutations, before it succumbs and permits the well-known signs of AIDS to develop.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is PCR?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2655
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): A method for amplifying a DNA base sequence using a heat- stable polymerase and two 20- base primers, one complementary to the (+)- strand at one end of the sequence to be amplified and the other complementary to the (- )- strand at the other end. Because the newly synthesized DNA strands can subsequently serve as additional templates for the same primer sequences, successive rounds of primer annealing, strand elongation, and dissociation produce rapid and highly specific amplification of the desired sequence. PCR also can be used to detect the existence of the defined sequence in a DNA sample.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 770
PCR A laboratory technique that can amplify the amount of DNA from a tiny sample to a large amount within just a few hours. Theoretically, PCR can take one molecule and produce measurable amounts of identical DNA in a short period of time. It is used in DNA fingerprinting and DNA sequencing. An enzyme used in this process was originally found in bacteria in hot springs

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Convection?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2780
convection, mode of heat transfer in fluids (liquids and gases). Convection depends on the fact that, in general, fluids expand when heated and thus undergo a decrease in density (since a given volume of the fluid contains less matter at a higher temperature than at the original, lower temperature). As a result, the warmer, less dense portion of the fluid will tend to rise through the surrounding cooler fluid, in accordance with Archimedes principle. If heat continues to be supplied, the cooler fluid that flows in to replace the rising warmer fluid will also become heated and also rise. Thus, a current, called a convection current, becomes established in the fluid, with warmer, less dense fluid continually rising from the point of application of heat and cooler, denser portions of the fluid flowing outward and downward to replace the warmer fluid. In this manner, heat eventually may be transferred to the entire fluid. Convection currents are widely observed in both liquids and gases. Many aspects of weather are connected with convection currents. For example, when a portion of the atmosphere becomes heated by contact with a warm area of land, it rises into the cooler, higher altitudes, with the result that some of the moisture carried with it may be condensed to form clouds and precipitation. Convection currents have been used for heating and ventilation since ancient times. Both hot-air and hot-water heating systems use convection to transfer heat through the entire structure being heated. Convection currents also assist in the ventilation of mines.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Tourettes Syndrome?
QUESTION CONTENT: What causes Tourettes and what is the prognosis?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2631
It is a neurobiologic disorder in the brain that causes involuntary vocal tremors and tics.  It is migratory (ie: not usually the same tics all the time, they change).  It is lifelong and there is not a cure yet. There are medications that can lessen the impact of the tics and make them less noticeable.  It takes time and patience to find the right combination, depending upon the severity of the Tourettes.  My son has Tourettes, accompanied by OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and ADHD.  It is not uncommon to have Tourettes plus these conditions, or even others.There has been a breakthrough at Harvard (see link below, click on Genetic Breakthrough) which is cause for hope.If you have any questions about diagnosing Tourettes for yourself or a family  member or loved one, see a Neurologist.  I have learned that well meaning teachers, parents, pediatricians, nurses or others are not qualified to diagnose this disorder.  See a Pediatric Neurologist (if the person is under 16 or so) or a Neurologist.Best wishes to you.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Zero Point Energy?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2656
Quantum physics predicts the existence of an underlying sea of zero-point energy at every point in the universe. This is different from the cosmic microwave background and is also referred to as the electromagnetic quantum vacuum since it is the lowest state of otherwise empty space. This energy is so enormous that most physicists believe that even though zero-point energy seems to be an inescapable consequence of elementary quantum theory, it cannot be physically real, and so is subtracted away in calculations. A minority of physicists accept it as real energy which we cannot directly sense since it is the same everywhere, even inside our bodies and measuring devices. From this perspective, the ordinary world of matter and energy is like a foam atop the quantum vacuum sea. It does not matter to a ship how deep the ocean is below it. If the zero-point energy is real, there is the possibility that it can be tapped as a source of power or be harnassed to generate a propulsive force for space travel. The propellor or the jet engine of an aircraft push air backwards to propel the aircraft forward. A ship or boat propellor does the same thing with water. On Earth there is always air or water available to push against. But a rocket in space has nothing to push against, and so it needs to carry propellant to eject in place of air or water. The fundamental problem is that a deep space rocket would have to start out with all the propellant it will ever need. This quickly results in the need to carry more and more propellant just to propel the propellant. The breakthrough one wishes for deep space travel is to overcome the need to carry propellant at all. How can one generate a propulsive force without carrying and ejecting propellant? There is a force associated with the electromagnetic quantum vacuum: the Casimir force. This force is an attraction between parallel metallic plates that has now been well measured and can be attributed to a minutely tiny imbalance in the zero-point energy in the cavity between versus the region outside the plates. This is not useful for propulsion since it symmetrically pulls on the plates. However if some asymmetric variation of the Casimir force could be identified one could in effect sail through space as if propelled by a kind of quantum fluctuation wind. This is pure speculation. The other requirement for space travel is energy. A thought experiment published by physicist Robert Forward in 1984 demonstrated how the Casimir force could in principle be used to extract energy from the quantum vacuum (Phys. Rev. B, 30, 1700, 1984). Theoretical studies in the early 1990s (Phys. Rev. E, 48, 1562, 1993) verified that this was not contradictory to the laws of thermodynamics (since the zero-point energy is different from a thermal reservoir of heat). Unfortunately the Forward process cannot be cycled to yield a continuous extraction of energy. A Casimir engine would be one whose cylinders could only fire once, after which the engine become useless. ORIGIN OF ZERO-POINT ENERGY The basis of zero-point energy is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, one of the fundamental laws of quantum physics. According to this principle, the more precisely one measures the position of a moving particle, such as an electron, the less exact the best possible measurement of momentum (mass times velocity) will be, and vice versa. The least possible uncertainty of position times momentum is specified by Planck s constant, h. A parallel uncertainty exists between measurements involving time and energy. This minimum uncertainty is not due to any correctable flaws in measurement, but rather reflects an intrinsic quantum fuzziness in the very nature of energy and matter. A useful calculational tool in physics is the ideal harmonic oscillator: a hypothetical mass on a perfect spring moving back and forth. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that such an ideal harmonic oscillator -- one small enough to be subject to quantum laws -- can never come entirely to rest, since that would be a state of exactly zero energy, which is forbidden. In this case the average minimum energy is one-half h times the frequency, hf/2. Radio waves, light, X-rays, and gamma rays are all forms of electromagnetic radiation. Classically, electromagnetic radiation can be pictured as waves flowing through space at the speed of light. The waves are not waves of anything substantive, but are in fact ripples in a state of a field. These waves do carry energy, and each wave has a specific direction, frequency and polarization state. This is called a propagating mode of the electromagnetic field. Each mode is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. To understand the meaning of this, the theory of electromagnetic radiation is quantized by treating each mode as an equivalent harmonic oscillator. From this analogy, every mode of the field must have hf/2 as its average minimum energy. That is a tiny amount of energy, but the number of modes is enormous, and indeed increases as the square of the frequency. The product of the tiny energy per mode times the huge spatial density of modes yields a very high theoretical energy density per cubic centimeter. From this line of reasoning, quantum physics predicts that all of space must be filled with electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations (alsocalled the zero-point field) creating a universal sea of zero-point energy. The density of this energy depends critically on where in frequency the zero-point fluctuations cease. Since space itself is thought to break up into a kind of quantum foam at a tiny distance scale called the Planck scale (10-33 cm), it is argued that the zero point fluctuations must cease at a corresponding Planck frequency (1043 Hz). If that is the case, the zero-point energy density would be 110 orders of magnitude greater than the radiant energy at the center of the Sun. CONNECTION TO INERTIA AND GRAVITATION When a passenger in an airplane feels pushed against his seat as the airplane accelerates down the runway, or when a driver feels pushed to the left when her car makes a sharp turn to the right, what is doing the pushing? Since the time of Newton, this has been attributed to an innate property of matter called inertia. In 1994 a process was discovered whereby the zero-point fluctuations could be the source of the push one feels when changing speed or direction, both being forms of acceleration. The zero-point fluctuations could be the underlying cause of inertia. If that is the case, then we are actually sensing the zero-point energy with every move we make (see origin of inertia). The principle of equivalence would require an analogous connection for gravitation. Einstein s general relativity successfully accounts for the motions of freely-falling objects on geodesics (the shortest distance between two points in curved spacetime), but does not provide a mechanism for generating a gravitational force for objects when they are forced to deviate from geodesic tracks. It has been found that an object undergoing acceleration or one held fixed in a gravitational field would experience the same kind of asymmetric pattern in the zero-point field giving rise to such a reaction force. The weight you measure on a scale would therefore be due to zero-point energy (see gravitation). The possibility that electromagnetic zero-point energy may be involved in the production of inertial and gravitational forces opens the possibility that both inertia and gravitation might someday be controlled and manipulated. This could have a profound impact on propulsion and space travel.

QUESTION SUBJECT: How did Americans prepare for a nuclear war? What was McCarthyism?
QUESTION CONTENT: How did Rosa Parks help begin the civil rights movement? How did roads improve in the 1950s? How did the Russians start the space race?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2706
Nuclear war - they taught the children to get under their desk and then bought a bunch of nuclear weapons.  McCarthyism was when the Senate called a bunch of people from hollywood to testify and name names of people who went to a meeting of the communist party.  Rosa Parks helped the civil rights movement which had already been started by allowing the local NAACP to make it a big case and go through the court system.  Interesting to note is that there were other women who didn t get on the back of the bus and they paid their fine but their names later appeared on the supreme court case.Roads improved in the 50s because Eisenhower pushed through the highway system. This is because he wanted troops to go from california to new york or virginia in a fast amount of time, say 4 days instead of 50, to be able to get to a war in the european theater if need be.  The Russians are noteable in the space race for the launching of the satellite sputnik.

Claude Lemieux for what he did to Kris Draper in game 6 of the Western Conference finals ten years ago. Everybody saw it and everybody agrees it was intentional. One of the most vile acts I d ever seen in sports. He should have been suspended for the rest of the playoffs AND a chunk of the regular season, PLUS fined, but NOOOOOO. He gets off with a measly two-game suspention and gets to hoist the cup. It was sickening.

Of the active players I agree with you about Eric Lindros. Iagree with every thing yu said about Lindros and as long as Lindros plays I hope he never wins the Stanley Cup.OF players that are ritired it is a toss up between Bobby Clarke and Ulf Samuelsson. I hated Clarke because he would never fight his own battles and got protected.I hate Ulf Samuelsson because of the hit he put on Cam Neely. He hit Neely between the hip and knee with his knee. And of the dirty hits he would give. And he would never drop his gloves and fight. One of the guys I work with said that be glad he ins t playing anymore and doing more damage.

QUESTION SUBJECT: what is EFQM?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2782
EFQM stands for European Foundation for Quality Management.The EFQM Excellence Model is a key framework for helping organizations in their drive towards being more competitive.Regardless of sector, size, structure or maturity, to be successful, organizations need to establish an appropriate management system. The EFQM Excellence Model is a practical tool to help organizations do this by measuring where they are on the path to Excellence; helping them understand the gaps; and then stimulating solutions.Over the years a number of research studies have investigated the correlation between the adoption of holistic Models, such as the EFQM Excellence Model, and improved organisational results. The majority of such studies show a positive linkage. One of the most comprehensive of these was carried out by Dr. Vinod Singhal of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr. Kevin Hendricks of the College of William and Mary.The Model is key in four ways:As a framework which organisations can use to help them develop their vision and goals for the future in a tangible, measurable way As a framework which organisations can use to help them identify and understand the systemic nature of their business, the key linkages and cause and effect relationships. As the basis for the European Quality Award, a process which allows Europe to recognise its most successful organisations and promote them as role models of Excellence for others to learn from. As a diagnostic tool for assessing the current health of the organisation. Through this process an organisation is better able to balance its priorities, allocate resources and generate realistic business plans. This fourth, diagnostic use, is also known as self-assessment.

QUESTION SUBJECT: Actually what is GMO ?
QUESTION CONTENT: 
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2636
GMO = Genetically Modified Organisms.  these are organisms that have been transfected with DNA from different organisms, such as putting a gene for human s blood clotting factor into a haster s kidney cell to produce a treatment for hemophilia.  It generally is used to refer to produce with genes that are put there to make the plant resistant to disease, make it grow faster or better in harsher climates, or to amplify desirable traits.  many people fear GMOs because the technology is new and the side effects are unknown.  of course, the side effects are (in my professional opinion) probably much less severe than the well-known and documented side effects of chemical pesticides, fertilizer run off, blights, famines, and mass starvation.NOTE: GMO refers to changes made by genetic transfection, NOT by hybridization, natural mutation, or selective breeding.  It refers quite specifically to recombinant DNA technology.

QUESTION SUBJECT: What is Digital Animation?
QUESTION CONTENT: I really love cartoon, toys and everything. Can anyone tell me full details about Digital Animation?
(BEST) ANSWER ID: 2994
There are 2 different types of digital animation. 2D and 3D. Both have their difficulties and charms.  2D, like Total Drama Island, (only thing that popped into my head) is done with the program Flash, It s done by creating all the characters in pieces, arms legs,mouths, heads, etc. then arranging those parts in the program to pose the character, and moving those parts to create motion. A foundation in traditional animation, and very good drawing skills along with the knowledge of how to use the programs are the key things you would need in this type. 3D, Like Shriek or the Increadibles. are done by pre-modeling the characters, which are much like puppets. They have an internal bone structure which allows for more realistic limited movement. There would be a person designing and modeling the character, rigging it, and probably another person animating. To do well in this type you need a solid foundation in life drawing, and anatomy, along with how to use the programs.  There are people in the 3D animation industry that don t know how to draw, some are sculptures, and others are puppeteers in a way. That have a very good understanding of acting, movement and the programs.  This is rare though, any animator should try and have the best drawing skills they are capable of to expect to find work.

Yes actual freedom is when you have the ability to do what you like and dislike.   When you do only the things that you like , you are free only superficially. You only think that you are free. You are actually ruled by your heart or mind.  So how can you say that you are free when your mind or your heart is ruling your soul ?? Total freedom is when you have no restrictions , not from your mind , not from your heart , not from any other person??? what ever comes your way , if you are able to swim along the tides coming your way easily, then you are free. You have attained total freedom.

(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1337
Ability to do something that you do not like is irrelevant. Ability and leeway to do what you want to do is freedom.... which is a myth because different people want different things and their wants cross swords... therefore one person s freedom is another person s restraint... your freedom is therefore subject to the concurrence of others that is not possible all the time.
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 1338
Experience has shown me that freedom is one of my most precious gifts. Freedom to me is not being a victim to my emotions; not being a victim to my thinking ( which isn t always right ) and not being subject to the scrutiny of others who can t trust my behavior because my behavior is no longer a threat to myself or to others.Freedom to me is the ability to be who i am withour reservation or restriction.And since my freedom is based on my faith in The Almighty i am above the petty restrictions of mortal men, which most know as laws-- because i follow the guidance of The Almighty i don t overstep th boundaries of the law.Freedom is something NO other human being can take from me, but that by my actions, i could cause to be taken from me.

(BEST) ANSWER ID: 3014
Periostin is a disulfide linked 90 kDa, 811 amino acid protein originally isolated as a osteoblast-specific factor that unctions as a cell adhesion molecule for preosteoblasts and is thought to be involved in osteoblast recruitment, attachment and spreading. Additionally, periostin expression has previously been shown to be significantly increased by both transforming growth factor beta-1(TGFbeta1) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2).Click theses links for more info if you like:http://www.biovendor.com/pdf/RD172045100.pdfhttp://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&aq=t&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4SUNA_enUS222US228&q=periostin
(OTHER) ANSWER ID: 3015
a protein with structural and sequence homology with a TGF-??-inducible gene, ??ig-h3, is upregulated in colorectal cancers and their liver metastasis, and it may play a role in promoting growth in these tumors. In vitrostudies reveal that periostin promotes growth and cell proliferation in colorectal cancers and that this effect can be abrogated with antibodies to periostin. Hope this helps. :-)

A core idea is to create a leap in value for both the company and its buyers by breaking the differentiation/low cost trade-off and achieve systems alignment of value, profit and profit propositions.Blue Ocean Strategy is the result of a decade-long study of 150 strategic moves spanning more than 30 industries over 100 years (1880-2000). In addition to retrospective case studies, the book offers theoretical approaches and practical tools to create and capture blue oceans . Kim and Mauborgne argue that tomorrow???s leading companies will succeed not by battling competitors, but by creating ???blue oceans??? of uncontested market space ripe for growth.This best seller sold more than a million copies in its first year of publication and is being published in 39 languages.[The ConceptThe metaphor of red and blue oceans describes the market universe. Red oceans are all the industries in existence today???the known market space. In the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of product or service demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities or niche, and cutthroat competition turns the red ocean bloody. Hence, the term red oceans.[3]Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today???the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored. [4]The corner-stone of Blue Ocean Strategy is Value Innovation . A blue ocean is created when a company achieves value innovation that creates value simultaneously for both the buyer and the company. The innovation (in product, service, or delivery) must raise and create value for the market, while simultaneously reducing or eliminating features or services that are less valued by the current or future market. The authors critique Michael Porter s idea that successful business are either low-cost providers or niche-players. Instead, they propose finding value that crosses conventional market segmentation and offering value and lower cost.If you find this useful the choose it as the best answer.
